NCT02107989,Noninvasive Pre-surgical Evaluation of Patients With Focal Epilepsy and Establishment of a Normative Imaging Database,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02107989,RECRUITING,"Objectives:

The overall study objective is to compare the sensitivities and specificities of morphometric analysis techniques using structural MRI images based on pre- and postsurgical localization of epileptic foci in patients undergoing presurgical evaluation for medically refractory epilepsy. To carry out these analyses, we aim to establish an age-stratified normative imaging database using healthy volunteers. Additional objectives are to identify abnormal networks in these patients using resting state fMRI/EEG and MEG/EEG, and to use language and memory fMRI tasks to examine the effects of epileptogenic zones and surgery on cognitive function and the networks associated with these functions.

Study population:

300 adults and children (age 8 and older) with uncontrolled focal epilepsy, and 200 age-stratified healthy volunteers.

Design: A retrospective and prospective natural history study. Research procedures for patients in this study include neuropsychological testing and 1-4 MRI sessions during presurgical evaluation and an additional 1-3 MRI sessions and neuropsychological testing approximately 12 months post-operatively. Research testing (such as research neuropsychological tests or MRI scanning sequences) will be done during a visit for clinical testing whenever possible, likely reducing the number of required visits. Patients will also have optional MEG and 7T structural imaging. Data will also be obtained from patients who have already undergone epilepsy surgery if they had procedures as outlined in the protocol and are willing to share the data. Healthy volunteers will receive a subset of the pre-operative procedures for patients, requiring at least 3 visits. In order to ensure adequate data acquisition, subjects may be re-scanned up to three times for the portions of the study in which they participated, possibly requiring additional visits.

Outcome measures:

The main outcomes will be establishment of normative values for morphometric analysis methods in age-stratified normal controls, and comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of these measures to pre- and postsurgical localization of the epileptogenic zone. Secondary outcome measures will include determination of the sensitivity and specificity of source localization using MEG/EEG and resting state fMRI/EEG, and to evaluate changes in activation during rest, as well as language and memory fMRI tasks in patients pre- and postsurgically, to examine the effects of epileptogenic zones and surgery on cognitive function and the networks underlying these functions.",Epilepsy,DEVICE: MRI|DEVICE: MEG,"All outcomes in this study are Exploratory., All outcomes in this study are Exploratory., All outcomes in this study are Exploratory.",National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,500,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,3/11/2014,3/30/2028,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States"

People with epilepsy who are considering surgery and healthy volunteers who are right-handed and between the ages of 7 and 55 may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures twice, and, in some cases, possibly three times, in two or three visits of 2 to 4 hours each.

Neuropsychological tests: Testing includes questionnaires, pen-and-pencil or computerized tests and motor tasks.

Structural MRI: This procedure uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain pictures of brain structure. During the test, the subject lies in the scanner (a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field) for about 90 minutes, wearing earmuffs to muffle knocking noises the machine makes. Subjects may be asked to lie still for up to 10 minutes at a time.

Functional MRI: This procedure is similar to structural MRI, except a coil is placed over the head and the subject performs simple tasks during the procedure. The pictures obtained show what parts of the brain are being used to perform the task. The test lasts about 60 minutes, with subjects asked to lie still for up to 10 minutes at a time.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG): For MEG, the subject sits in an MEG recording room with a cone containing magnetic field detectors lowered onto his or her head. Very small magnetic changes produced by the activity of the brain are recorded while the subject sits quietly or performs a research task. An EEG recording of the electrical activity of the brain is done at the same time as the MEG.

NCT00006191,Effect of Levetiracetam on Brain Excitability,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00006191,COMPLETED,"This study will examine the effect of the newly developed anti-epileptic drug, levetiracetam, on excitability of the cortex (surface layer) of the brain. Levetiracetam works differently from other anti-seizure drugs, but its mechanism is not well understood. This study may provide insight into a new protection mechanism against seizures as well as the effect of the drug on cortical excitability.

Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a medical history taken and undergo physical and neurological examinations.

Participants will undergo two different procedures in four separate sessions. One procedure (cortical excitability) involves taking either levetiracetam or placebo (a look-alike inactive substance) and having transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The other procedure (pinch-training related changes) involves taking levetiracetam or placebo, doing a motor exercise called pinch training, and having transcranial magnetic stimulation. For TMS, a very brief electrical current is passed through an insulated coil wire placed on the scalp. The magnetic pulse travels through the scalp and skull, causing small electrical currents in the cortex that may cause muscle, hand, or arm twitching or it may affect movements or reflexes. During the study, subjects may be asked to make movements, do simple tasks or tense muscles. Electrical activity of the muscles will be recorded using electrodes taped to the skin over the muscle. For the pinch training, the subject makes a brief, brisk pinch after each beat of a metronome every two seconds and then completely relaxes the hand until the next beat.

Subjects will be tested on four different days at least 72 hours apart. Each session will last about 3 to 4 hours.

- The blood-brain barrier separates the brain from the rest of the body. Epilepsy is a neurological disease that causes seizures. It can affect this barrier. Researchers think a contrast agent called mangafodipir might be better able to show areas of the brain that epilepsy affects.

Objective:

- To see if mangafodipir is well tolerated and safe. To see if it can show, on an MRI, areas of the brain that epilepsy affects.

Eligibility:

* People ages 18-60 who:
* Have epilepsy not controlled by drugs
* Prior or concurrent enrollment in 18-N-0066 is required

Design:

* Participants will be screened with:
* Medical history
* Physical exam
* Blood and urine tests
* Participants will have up to 6 visits in 1-3 months. Those with epilepsy will have an inpatient stay lasting 2-10 days. Visits may include:
* Video-EEG monitoring for participants with epilepsy
* An IV catheter put in place: a needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein.
* Getting mangafodipir through the IV.
* 5 MRI scans over a 10-day period: a magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the brain. Participants lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder. They are in the cylinder for 45-90 minutes, lying still for up to 10 minutes at a time. The scanner makes loud knocking sounds. Participants will get earplugs.

Pursuing this signal from a novel platform with invasive intracranial recording electrodes provides much-needed spatial and temporal resolution to characterize the neural dynamics of socio-affective processing. The investigators will leverage first-in-human intracranial neural recording opportunities created by a novel therapeutic platform termed ""stereotactic electroencephalography-informed deep brain stimulation"" (stereo-EEG-informed DBS), as well as the powerful platform of intracranial stereotactic recording and stimulation in patients undergoing epilepsy surgical evaluation at Baylor College of Medicine. The sEEG-informed DBS trial provides unique opportunities for intracranial recording of affect-relevant network regions in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Recordings in identical regions in epilepsy patients who themselves often demonstrate mild-moderate depressive symptoms will provide a wide dynamic range across the symptom spectrum. To provide critical data on the spatiotemporal dynamics of socio-affective processing the investigators will leverage these two human intracranial recording and stimulation cohorts to study the precise structural, functional, and causal properties of the affective salience network. Greater understanding of the social processing circuitry mediated by the affective salience network may be used to drive therapeutic innovation, pioneering a new paradigm that improves socio-emotional function across a wide variety of neuropsychiatric conditions.

Two examples of DEEs are STXBP1 and SLC6A1, though there are dozens of others.

STXBP1 Encephalopathy is a severe disease that can cause seizures and developmental delays in infants and children. SLC6A1 neurodevelopmental disorder is characterized by developmental delay and often epilepsy. Both STXBP1 encephalopathy and SLC6A1 neurodevelopmental disorder cause symptoms because there are not enough working proteins made by these genes.

It is possible that a medication called phenylbutyrate may help the the remaining proteins work better for STXBP1, SLC6A1, and/or other similar DEEs caused by single genes (i.e. ""monogenetic"").

NCT00057460,Effect of Talampanel (an AMPA Receptor Blocker) on Brain Activity,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00057460,COMPLETED,"This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to test the safety of an experimental anti-epileptic drug called Talampanel and learn how it affects brain activity. Talampanel blocks a type of brain receptor called AMPA; inhibiting this receptor may result in anti-seizure activity.

TMS stimulates the outer part of the brain, called the cortex. For this procedure, an insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. This may cause a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and muscle twitching in the face, arm, or leg.

EEG records the electrical activity of the brain, in the form of brain waves. For this procedure, electrodes (metal discs with a conductive gel) attached to wires are affixed to the scalp with a paste and the brain activity is recorded.

Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age may participate in this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical and neurological examination, electrocardiogram (EKG), blood tests, and blood pressure measurement. Women who are pregnant or nursing are excluded from the study.

Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center for three testing sessions, at least 1 week apart, and a final follow-up visit. The procedure for each test session is as follows:

7 AM - Blood pressure is measured, EKG and EEC leads are placed, a heparin lock is inserted, and a blood sample is drawn. The heparin lock is a thin needle enclosed in a thin plastic tube. The needle guides the tube into a vein and is then removed, leaving the tube in place. The indwelling tube allows multiple blood samples to be drawn without repeated needle sticks.

8 - 9 AM - TMS followed by EEG recording.

9 AM - Administration of Talampanel or placebo (pill with no active ingredient) by mouth.

10 AM - Blood sample #2.

10 AM -11 AM - TMS, followed by EEG recording every 5 minutes.

11 AM - Blood sample #3.

12 PM - Blood sample #4.

11 AM - 1 PM - EEG recording every 5 minutes/

4 PM - Blood sample #5.

Patients with NES have 3 teaspoons of blood drawn. The blood is tested for two genes that are normally found in healthy individuals to see if they are found more frequently in patients with uncontrolled shaking.

Patients with FMD have blood drawn for testing and also undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at how the brain functions while the subject performs a specific task. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. During the scan, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner, a metal cylinder. The scan lasts about 60 to 90 minutes, during which the subject may be asked to lie still for up to 10 minutes at a time and to perform tasks, such as identifying the gender of faces shown on a screen.

Subjects fulfilling the study entry criteria at Screening and at Baseline including a comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or retina specialist and a skin assessment by the investigator will receive ezogabine/retigabine.

The starting dose of ezogabine/retigabine will be 300 mg/day. Subjects will be up titrated by 150 mg/day weekly up to the maximum ezogabine/retigabine daily dose of 1200 mg (or the highest tolerated dose).

Wireless and battery powered, it uses the latest mobile technology. Contrary to the clinical EEG, this headset does not use any glue between the skin and the electrodes. Minor skin irritation may still occur but much less likely than from the collodion glue used in the clinical electrodes. In addition, the zEEG system does not need any gel to be applied to the skin. The zEEG electrodes are dry and disposable. They have never been used on any other head before. No additional risk is involved with setting it up. In addition to the clinically necessary EEG electrodes or intracranial electrodes for long term monitoring, we will place zEEG on the head to compare the sensitivity of the new device to the traditional device. zEEG is proven to meet the standard of clinical system and received an FDA clearance in 2018.

NCT04086992,Decreasing Parental Stress of Caregivers of Infants With Infantile Spasms by Using Telemedicine Technology,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04086992,UNKNOWN,"This study plans to learn more about how the use of new telemedicine technology can help with parental stress, costs, and overall satisfaction in care. Investigators are studying this in families who have children with a specific seizure type called infantile spasms and being treated with a medication called ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Infantile spasms is a rare epileptic encephalopathy that occurs within the first two years of life. It is associated with complicated and expensive treatment and poor developmental outcomes. Participants will be randomly placed in one of two groups. The first group will continue with the traditional monitoring practices primarily performed by their pediatrician. The second group will use telemedicine technology to be monitored. Investigators will then compare the two groups to see if there are any differences in parental stress, costs of care, and/or overall satisfaction with care.

The primary hypothesis is that compared to those utilizing usual monitoring, parents/caregivers of infants with IS treated with ACTH utilizing nurse-led remote biometric monitoring will report less parenting stress at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment.","Infantile Spasms, Non-Intractable",OTHER: Remote monitoring,"Compare parental stress between intervention group and control group, Parental stress will be measures by the Pediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP), a previously validated survey.

Affective symptoms are a common feature of neuropsychiatric disorders that reflect dysfunction in a distributed brain network that supports emotion. How aberrant functioning in a single emotion network underlies a wide range of affective symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, is not well understood. Anchored by the anterior cingulate cortex and ventral anterior insula, the emotion network responds to numerous affective stimuli. The recording of neural activity directly from the cortical surface from individuals is a promising approach since intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) can provide direct estimates of neuronal populations to map the spatiotemporal dynamics of the emotion network at a millisecond level resolution. This study will exam how activity within emotion network hubs changes during emotions and how emotion network properties make some individuals more vulnerable to affective symptoms than others.

* People with epilepsy often have auditory processing disorders that affect their ability to hear clearly and may cause problems with understanding speech and other kinds of verbal communication. Researchers are interested in developing better ways of studying what parts of the brain are affected by hearing disorders and epilepsy, and they need better clinical tests to measure how individuals process sound. These tests will allow researchers to examine and evaluate the effects of epilepsy and related disorders on speech and communication.
* A procedure called a magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be used to measure the electrical currents involved in brain activity. Researchers are interested in learning whether MEG can be used to detect differences in the processing of simple sounds in patients with epilepsy, both with and without hearing impairments.

Objectives:

- To measure brain activity in hearing impaired persons with epilepsy and compare the results with those from people with normal hearing and epilepsy as well as people with normal hearing and no epilepsy. This research is performed in collaboration with Johns Hopkins Hospital and epilepsy patients must be candidates for surgery at Johns Hopkins.

Eligibility:

* Individuals between 18 to 55 years of age who (1) have epilepsy and have hearing impairments, (2) have epilepsy but do not have hearing impairments, or (3) are healthy volunteers who have neither epilepsy nor hearing impairments.
* Participants with epilepsy must have developed seizures after 10 years of age, and must be candidates for grid implantation surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital..

Design:

* This study will require one visit of approximately 4 to 6 hours.
* Participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history, along with a basic hearing test.
* Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain, followed by a MEG scan to record magnetic field changes produced by brain activity.
* During MEG recording, participants will be asked to listen to various sounds and make simple responses (pressing a button, moving your hand or speaking) in response to sounds heard through earphones. The MEG procedure should take between 1 and 2 hours.

NCT05871372,Intracranial Investigation of Neural Circuity Underlying Human Mood,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05871372,RECRUITING,"Depression is one of the most common disorders of mental health, affecting 7-8% of the population and causing tremendous disability to afflicted individuals and economic burden to society. In order to optimize existing treatments and develop improved ones, the investigators need a deeper understanding of the mechanistic basis of this complex disorder. Previous work in this area has made important progress but has two main limitations. (1) Most studies have used non-invasive and therefore imprecise measures of brain activity. (2) Black box modeling used to link neural activity to behavior remain difficult to interpret, and although sometimes successful in describing activity within certain contexts, may not generalize to new situations, provide mechanistic insight, or efficiently guide therapeutic interventions. To overcome these challenges, the investigators combine precise intracranial neural recordings in humans with a suite of new eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches. The investigators have assembled a team of experimentalists and computational experts with combined experience sufficient for this task. Our unique dataset comprises two groups of subjects: the Epilepsy Cohort consists of patients with refractory epilepsy undergoing intracranial seizure monitoring, and the Depression Cohort consists of subjects in an NIH/BRAIN-funded research trial of deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). As a whole, this dataset provides precise, spatiotemporally resolved human intracranial recording and stimulation data across a wide dynamic range of depression severity. Our Aims apply a progressive approach to modeling and manipulating brain-behavior relationships. Aim 1 seeks to identify features of neural activity associated with mood states. Beginning with current state-of-the-art AI models and then uses a ""ladder"" approach to bridge to models of increasing expressiveness while imposing mechanistically explainable structure. Whereas Aim 1 focuses on self-reported mood level as the behavioral index of interest, Aim 2 uses an alternative approach of focusing on measurable neurobiological features inspired by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). These features, such as reward sensitivity, loss aversion, executive attention, etc. are extracted from behavioral task performance using a novel ""inverse rational control"" XAI approach.

Relating these measures to neural activity patterns provides additional mechanistic and normative understanding of the neurobiology of depression. Aim 3 uses recurrent neural networks to model the consequences of richly varied patterns of multi-site intracranial stimulation on neural activity. Then employing an innovative ""inception loop"" XAI approach to derive stimulation strategies for open- and closed-loop control that can drive the neural system towards a desired, healthier state. If successful, this project would enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of depression and improve neuromodulatory treatment strategies.

Pyrimidine and purine metabolism disorders (DPPMs) affect how the body metabolizes chemicals called pyrimidines and purines. DPPMs can cause dysfunctions throughout the body, especially in the brain, blood, kidneys, and immune system. People with DPPMs might have no symptoms, mild symptoms, or they may have severe, chronic symptoms, that can be fatal. DPPMs are not well understood, and researchers want to learn more about what causes them and how to treat them.

Objective:

To learn more about factors that affect DPPMs by comparing test results from affected, uaffected family members, and healthy people.

Eligibility:

Three types of participants are needed: people aged 1 month and older with DPPMs; their family members who do not have DPPMs; and healthy volunteers.

Design:

Participants with DPPMs will come to the clinic once a year; some may be asked to come more often. At each visit, all affected participants will have a physical exam and give samples of blood, urine, saliva, and stool. Depending on their symptoms, they may also have other procedures, such as:

Swabs of their skin and inside the mouth.

Tests of their heart, kidney, brain, and nerve function.

Questionnaires about what they eat.

Dental exams, and exams of their hearing and vision.

Tests of their learning ability.

Monitoring of their physical activity.

Imaging scans.

Photographs of their face and body.

These tests may be spread over up to 7 days. Affected participants may remain in the study indefinitely if they wish to.

Healthy volunteers and family members will have 1 study visit. They will have a physical exam and may be asked to give blood, urine, saliva, and stool samples.","AMPD3, OMIM*102772, AMP Deaminase Deficiency|AK1, OMIM *103000, Adenylate Kinase Deficiency|AMPD1, OMIM *102770, Myopathy Due to Myoadenylate Deaminase Deficiency|TPMT, OMIM *187680, Thoipurines, Poor Metabolism of|IMPDH1, OMIM *146690, Retinitis Pigmentosa Type 10, Leber Congenital Amauriosis Type 11|APRT, OMIM *102600, Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase Deficiency|HPRT1, OMIM *308000 Lesch-Nyhan Disease|XDH, OMIM *607633, Xanthinuria Type 1|SLC2A9, OMIM *606142 Hypouricemia|SLC22A12, OMIM *607096 Hypouricemia|PRPS1 Def, OMIM *311850, Arts Syndrome; Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease|PRPS1 SA, OMIM *311850 Gout, PRPS-related Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate Synthetase Superactivity|AMPD2, OMIM *102771, Spastic Paraplegia 63; Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia|ITPA, OMIM *147520, Inosine Triphosphatase Deficiency; Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 35|ADSL, OMIM *608222, Adenylosuccinate Lyase Deficiency|PNP, OMIM *164050, Nucleoside Phosphorylase Deficiency|ADA2, OMIM *607575,Sneddon Syndrome; VAIHS|CAD, *1140120, Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy|UPB1, OMIM *606673, Beta-ureidopropionase Deficiency|DPYS, OMIM *613326, Dihydropyrimidinase Deficiency|DPYD, OMIM *274270, Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency|DHODH, OMIM *126064, Miller Syndrome (Postaxial Acrofacial Dysostosis)|UMPS, OMIM *613891, Orotic Aciduria|NT5C3A<TAB>, OMIM *606224, Anemia, Hemolytic, Due to UMPH1 Deficiency|UNG, OMIM *191525, Hyper-IgM Syndrome 5|AICDA, OMIM *605257, Immunodeficiency With Hyper-IgM, Type 2; HIGM2|Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism|Metabolic Disease",,"TP describe features of poorly characterized and novel DPPMs., DPPMs demonstrate significant inter- and intra-familial variability.

NCT00001672,Language Localization Using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in Patients With Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00001672,COMPLETED,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be able to provide a moderately detailed localization of language functions in the brain. We propose to test the ability of rTMS to locate the substrate of visual naming to a limited area of the temporal lobe in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy before and after surgical resections. The study is expected to yield information on the organization of language in the temporal lobes and how unilateral temporal lobe lesions and lobectomy cause relocation of language mechanisms in the lesioned and in the other hemisphere.

NCT01415362,Closed-loop System Using Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) for Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01415362,COMPLETED,"In this pilot study, the researchers investigated the feasibility of a closed-loop electroencephalography (EEG) / transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) system for treatment of epilepsy. They looked to see the feasibility of triggering tDCS stimulation within 10 seconds of a detected EEG partial-onset seizure, and also a proof-of-principle determination of whether tDCS applied during this vulnerable period may be feasible to prevent the oncoming seizure.

This study required 5 visits over the course of approximately 8 weeks. Each visit was separated by at least 2 weeks. Two of the visits had 24-hour EEG monitoring sessions. During these two sessions, the EEG and tDCS were hooked into a closed loop system, such that when seizure activity wasdetected, the tDCS was triggered to deliver stimulation. Subjects received active stimulation or sham stimulation sessions during the first 24-hour visit, and the opposite during the second. The subjects were randomized and counterbalanced.

We have also added a healthy subjects cohort to assess the feasibility of the closed loop system. In order to test the proof-of-concept of this system, the experiment will focus on detecting and acting upon alpha- and beta-band changes traced in the EEG activity that is being recorded, and provide tDCS stimulation based upon those changes.

NCT01273129,Surgery as a Treatment for Medically Intractable Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01273129,RECRUITING,"Background:

- Drug resistant epilepsy is the term used to describe epilepsy that cannot be controlled by medication. Many people whose seizures do not respond to medication will respond to surgical treatment, relieving seizures completely or almost completely in one-half to two-thirds of patients who qualify for surgery. The tests and surgery performed as part of this treatment are not experimental, but researchers are interested in using the data collected as part of routine standard epilepsy care to better understand epilepsy and its treatment.

Objectives:

- To use surgery as a treatment for drug resistant epilepsy in children and adults.

Eligibility:

- Children and adults at least 8 years of age who have simple or complex partial seizures (seizures that come from one area of the brain) that have not responded to medication, and who are willing to have brain surgery to treat their medically intractable epilepsy.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and neurological examination. Imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging and computer-assisted tomography (CT), may also be conducted as part of the screening. Participants who do not need surgery or whose epilepsy cannot be treated surgically will follow up with a primary care physician or neurologist and will not need to return to the National Institutes of Health for this study.
* Prior to the surgery, participants will have the following procedures to provide information on the correct surgical approach.
* Video electroencephalography monitoring to measure brain activity during normal activities within a 24-hour period. Three to four 15-minute breaks are allowed within this period.
* Electrodes placed directly in the brain or on the surface of the brain to measure brain activities and determine the part of the brain that is responsible for the seizures (seizure focus).
* Participants will have a surgical procedure at the site of their seizure focus. Brain lesions, abnormal blood vessels, tumors, infections, or other areas of brain abnormality will be either removed or treated in a way that will stop or help prevent the spread of seizures without affecting irreplaceable brain functions, such as the ability to speak, understand, move, feel, or see.
* Participants will return for outpatient visits and brain imaging studies 2 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery.","Epilepsy|Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe|Partial Epilepsy",,"Descriptive and/or correlational studies, By providing standard care treatment for patients with drug resistant epilepsy, this protocol allows for descriptive and/or correlational studies based on the data collected through clinical care of these patients including neurophysiological correlates of cognitive function and studies of tissue sample acquired during surgery.

The Investigators propose a pilot randomized, parallel-group, controlled trial comparing the GoToSleep program (GTS) and controls on change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) from baseline to week 8 in adults with epilepsy and moderate-to-severe insomnia.

Adults with epilepsy and moderate-to-severe insomnia symptoms (ISI ≥15) 17 will be identified using data collected as part of routine clinical care in the adult epilepsy clinic.

All subjects will be provided a consent form describing the study and provided sufficient information to make an informed decision. After a screening visit, subjects meeting study criteria will be randomized to the computerized cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CCBT-i) using the GoTosleep (GTS) or the control group. Both groups will receive a sleep hygiene handout that is standard of care in the treatment of insomnia. All subjects will be contacted by phone every 2 weeks during the intervention to address questions related to sleep hygiene instructions and use of the CCBT-i in the GoTosleep (GTS) group. All subjects will complete a series of sleep related patient reported outcomes including the ISI at baseline 8 weeks post randomization and maintain a diary recording of seizures and sleep periods. Those randomized to CCBT-i will complete a questionnaire at week 8 assessing barriers to CCBT-i.

NCT05605301,Pharmacokinetics Study of Oral 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (2DG) in Subjects With a Confirmed Diagnosis of Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05605301,COMPLETED,"This project studies how 2-deoxy-glucose (2DG) pills are absorbed and distributed in people with epilepsy. 2DG is similar to glucose, the main energy source for the brain, but it cannot be used as energy. During seizures, neurons are at a very high metabolic state with huge glucose metabolism as glycolysis is accelerated to supply the high metabolic needs of a seizure. 2DG is taken up by cells but cannot be metabolized by the first enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, thus is stops, or ""clogs up"", glycolysis. Since brain metabolism is almost entirely dependent on glucose as an energy source, glycolysis is arrested and may stop seizures. It is hoped that 2DG will stop seizures by interfering with the brain's energy use.

This is an open-label phase 2 study of the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of 2DG administered orally to adult epilepsy patients. A 3-level 2DG dose escalation is planned in sequential cohorts of 3 subjects in each cohort with review of each cohort before proceeding to the next cohort. On the day of oral 2DG exposure, subjects will receive a single dose of 40 mg in the first cohort, a single dose of 60 mg in the second cohort, and two 60 mg doses (60 mg bid) in the third cohort.

After 3 subjects have completed dosing at Dose Level 1 (40 mg/day), the safety and PK results will be reviewed. The Study Committee will determine if the next cohort should be enrolled at Dose Level 2 (60 mg/day). The same procedure will be repeated to determine if the next cohort should be enrolled at Dose Level 3 (60 mg bid = 120 mg/day). If the Study Committee determines that the most recent dose is not tolerated or that there are significant adverse events, the subsequent Dose Level will not be enrolled.

A standard time-concentration curve will be constructed from the 2DG levels obtained from the PK blood draws. Parameters will be calculated for: time to maximum concentration (tmax), maximum concentration (Cmax), elimination rate, half-life (t1/2), AUC, and derived parameters. Statistical analysis will not be performed because of the small n, but this will nevertheless establish the PK profile of 2DG in people with epilepsy.

NCT02929667,Abnormal Ventilatory Response to Carbon Dioxide: a Potential Biomarker for Seizure Induced Respiratory Depression & Modification by SSRI,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02929667,COMPLETED,"Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP) is devastating outcome for some patients with epilepsy. It ranks second only to stroke among neurological diseases in years of potential life lost. Patho-mechanisms of SUDEP remain not well understood, however peri-ictal respiratory dysfunction likely plays an important role in many cases.

Literature supports a critical role for the serotonergic system in central control of ventilation. Serotonin neurons in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem sense rising carbon dioxide and low pH, thereby stimulating breathing and arousal. These responses may serve as mechanisms that protect against asphyxia, particularly during sleep or the post-ictal state. In mouse models of seizure-induced sudden death, pre-treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) agents prevents death following seizures. Hence, the investigators hypothesize that a subset of drug resistant epilepsy patients who have impaired central chemo-responsiveness have a greater degree of peri-ictal respiratory depression, therefore a higher risk of SUDEP.

The investigators hypothesize that rTMS can modulate the hyperexcitable state in patients with deep seizure foci by targeting its usage to accessible cortical partner regions. In this study the investigators aim 1) to map the functional connectivity of the epileptogenic mesial temporal lobe in patients with medically refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; and 2) to perform a randomized controlled assessment of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols applied to specific neocortical targets in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

NCT05469373,ESIS in Pediatric DRE,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05469373,RECRUITING,"The main reason for this research study is to gain information about how the brain makes seizures by causing seizures using very small amounts of current, or electrical stimulation. Using small amounts of current to cause seizures (or stimulate) is not new at CCHMC - it is part of routine clinical practice for some patients at some electrodes.

This study differs from routine clinical care in that all study patients will undergo electrical stimulation in all or nearly all electrode contacts. The study team is doing this because there is promising data in adult patients that stimulating comprehensively (targeting all or nearly all of the electrode contacts) helps define the seizure network. Defining the seizure network in turn helps the medical team plan surgery. So far, there is not as much published data on seizure stimulation for pediatric patients.

This research study thus has the potential both to help individual patients (by providing specific information about your seizure networks) and to help pediatric patients with epilepsy in general (by increasing our understanding of stimulated seizures in children, teenagers and young adults).",Epilepsy,,"Safety -- Occurrence of generalized, convulsive and prolonged seizures, Evaluate the safety of ESIS in pediatric DRE patients., Phase II epilepsy surgery testing|Tolerability -- Quantify study withdrawal and patient/caregiver experience, Evaluate the tolerability of ESIS in pediatric DRE patients., during Phase II epilepsy surgery testing|Yield -- Rate of induction of habitual seizures, Evaluate the yield of ESIS in pediatric DRE patients., during Phase II epilepsy surgery testing|Clinical Validity, Test the clinical validity of ESIS in pediatric DRE patients by examining the impact of occurance of induced seizures on surgical outcomes., during Phase II epilepsy surgery testing and through study completion, an average of 1 year|Predictors, Investigate the methodologic, anatomic, and patient-specific predictors of induced seizures in pediatric DRE patients., during Phase II epilepsy surgery testing",Sarah Katie Ihnen,Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials|Child Neurologist Career Development Program,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",,86,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2/17/2022,6/30/2025,"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45229, United States"

NCT04325282,Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for BECTS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04325282,RECRUITING,"Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common pediatric epilepsy syndrome. Affected children typically have a mild seizure disorder, but yet have moderate difficulties with language, learning and attention that impact quality of life more than the seizures. Separate from the seizures, these children have very frequent abnormal activity in their brain known as interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs, or spikes), which physicians currently do not treat. These IEDs arise near the motor cortex, a region in the brain that controls movement.

In this study, the investigators will use a form of non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to determine the impact of IEDs on brain regions important for language to investigate: (1) if treatment of IEDs could improve language; and (2) if brain stimulation may be a treatment option for children with epilepsy.

Participating children will wear electroencephalogram (EEG) caps to measure brain activity. The investigators will use TMS to stimulate the brain region where the IEDs originate to measure how this region is connected to other brain regions. Children will then receive a special form of TMS called repetitive TMS (rTMS) that briefly reduces brain excitability. The study will measure if IEDs decrease and if brain connectivity changes after rTMS is applied.

The investigators hypothesize that the IEDs cause language problems by increasing connectivity between the motor cortex and language regions. The investigators further hypothesize that rTMS will reduce the frequency of IEDs and also reduce connectivity between the motor and language region",Benign Epilepsy With Centrotemporal Spikes|Language Problems|Learning Disorders,DEVICE: Active rTMS|DEVICE: Sham rTMS,"Interictal Epileptiform Discharge (IED) Frequency, We will count the number of IEDs/minute before and after application of active rTMS as well as before and after sham rTMS.

The drugs used for the MRI scan in this study will be chosen randomly. Half the patients will receive small doses of propofol and dexmedetomidine. The other half will receive propofol administered constantly throughout the scan. Other drugs that may be used include sevoflurane and nitrous oxide at the start of the sedation (for placing an intravenous), lidocaine (to reduce the pain of propofol injection) and glycopyrrolate (to prevent the heart rate from decreasing too low. The investigators will record 5 additional blood pressures and heart rates. If additional medications are required to complete the scan, the investigators will administer whatever is necessary. At the end of the study, the investigators will have an observer record the time it takes for participants to spontaneously open eyes , to be able to drink liquids and/or eat and to behave as before the study.

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique used to investigate the functional activity of the brain. The PET technique allows doctors to study the normal processes of the brain (central nervous system) of normal individuals and patients with neurologic illnesses without physical / structural damage to the brain.

When a region of the brain is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar (glucose). As the brain uses more fuel it produces more waste products, carbon dioxide and water. Blood carries fuel to the brain and waste products away from the brain. As brain activity increases blood flow to and from the area of activity increases also.

Researchers can label a sugar with a small radioactive molecule called FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose). As areas of the brain use more sugar the PET scan will detect the FDG and show the areas of the brain that are active. By using this technique researchers hope to answer the following questions;

4. Are changes in brain energy use (metabolism) present early in the course of epilepsy

5. Do changes in brain metabolism match the severity of patient's seizures

It is different from the ketogenic diet in four major ways: no calorie restriction, no fluid restriction, no protein restriction, and is easy to start outside the hospital. People on the Atkins Diet become ketotic (produce high levels of ketones, a certain substance in the body), like patients on the ketogenic diet, and the investigators believe this may lead to seizure control.

NCT02451696,A Pilot Study To Evaluate The Effects of Everolimus on Brain mTOR Activity and Cortical Hyperexcitability in TSC and FCD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02451696,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to measure if the drug called Everolimus effects mTOR signaling (an electrical activity signal in the brain) in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) with treatment resistant epilepsy (TRE) who will be undergoing brain surgery. One group of patients will be treated with Everolimus, and another will not. Researchers will determine if there is a difference in mTOR signaling between the patients who were treated with Everolimus and those who were not. Previous studies have suggested that Everolimus may reduce seizure activity in TSC patients by decreasing mTOR signaling. Since patients with FCD may also have excess mTOR signaling brain activity, Everolimus may also reduce seizure activity in these patients.

The drug Everolimus is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat specific types of breast, pancreatic, and kidney cancer, a kidney tumor called an angiomyolipoma (common in patients with TSC), and TSC patients who have a brain tumor called a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). However, in this research it is considered to be an investigational since it is not approved for reduction in mTOR signaling and a decrease in seizure frequency.

NCT00005925,Brain Infusion of Muscimol to Treat Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00005925,TERMINATED,"This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of infusing a chemical called muscimol into the brain to control seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy (frequent seizures that persist despite therapy). Muscimol, which is similar to a naturally occurring brain chemical called GABA, has been shown to reduce seizures in rats. After the infusion study, patients will undergo a standard surgical procedure for controlling seizures.

Patients 18 years of age or older with intractable epilepsy may be eligible for this study. Before entering protocol 00-N-0158, candidates will be screened under protocol 01-N-0139, Evaluation and Treatment of Patients with Epilepsy, with a medical history, physical and neurologic examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, blood and urine tests, electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.

Patients enrolled in this study will have the following procedures:

1. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head to guide catheter/electrode placement (see #2).
2. Depth catheter/electrode placement into the presumed location of the seizure focus (the part of the brain where the seizures originate) - A small hole is drilled through the skull. A depth electrode with a hole in the center of the tubing is passed through the brain into the structures usually involved in intractable epilepsy. MRI will be done to check electrode placement. Video-EEG monitoring will continue for 5 days for this part of the study. Patients will be tested for their ability to understand and produce speech, see normally, move their arms and legs, distinguish sharp and dull objects, and put pegs in a pegboard. They will be questioned about headache, weakness, numbness or sleepiness. The electrode will be left in place for muscimol infusion (see #3).
3. Muscimol infusion - Into the seizure focus, patients will be given two infusions-one of saline (salt water) alone and one of muscimol diluted in saline. Each infusion will be given over a period of one-half to 5 1/2 days, infused at the rate of 0.1 ml (1/50th of a teaspoon) per hour. During the infusions video-EEG recordings will continue and patients will be interviewed and examined as described in #2 above).
4. Blood testing - About 2 tablespoons of blood will be drawn daily during the testing period and for the first 2 days after surgery (see #5).
5. Surgery - Temporal lobectomy or topectomy (removal of a small, specific area of brain tissue) is the standard surgical treatment for medically intractable epilepsy whose seizure focus is not in a critical brain region, such as an area that controls language, movement, or sensation. If the patient's seizures arise from one of these areas, an alternative procedure called multiple subpial transection will be offered. In this procedure, vertical cuts are made in the seizure focus to prevent neurons (nerve cells that transmit electrical impulses) in the focus from spreading the seizure to the rest of the brain.
6. Surgery follow-up - Patients will be monitored in the surgical intensive care unit for 24 to 48 hours and then in the NINDS nursing unit for 4 to 8 days before being discharged to home.

NCT02639325,Tumor Related Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02639325,RECRUITING,"Background:

Some people with brain tumors have seizures related to the tumor. This is called tumor-related epilepsy. Usually brain tumors are treated by removing as much of the brain tumor as possible without causing problems. Researchers think this may improve the outcome for people with brain tumors. It may completely relieve or greatly reduce the number of seizures they have.

Objectives:

To evaluate people with brain tumors that are associated with seizures and to offer surgical treatment. Also, to study how surgery affects seizures.

Eligibility:

People age 8 and older who have a brain tumor with associated seizures. They must be willing to have brain surgery to treat their epilepsy.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.

Participants will have a medical history and physical exam.

Participants will be admitted to the hospital at NIH. They will have

Medical history

Physical exam

Neurological exam

Tests of memory, attention, and thinking

Questions about their symptoms and quality of life

Blood drawn

They may also have:

MRI or CT scan. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a machine that takes pictures. For part of the MRI, they will get a dye through an intravenous (IV) catheter.

Video electroencephalography monitoring. Electrodes will be placed on the scalp. The participant s brain waves will be recorded while doing normal activities. Participants will be videotaped.

Participants will keep a seizure diary before and after surgery.

Participants will have surgery to remove their brain tumor and the brain area where their seizures start.

They will stay in the hospital up to a week after surgery.

Participants have for follow-up visits at NIH.

NCT04344626,Use of a Tonometer to Identify Epileptogenic Lesions During Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04344626,WITHDRAWN,"Refractory epilepsy, meaning epilepsy that no longer responds to medication, is a common neurosurgical indication in children. In such cases, surgery is the treatment of choice. Complete resection of affected brain tissue is associated with highest probability of seizure freedom. However, epileptogenic brain tissue is visually identical to normal brain tissue, complicating complete resection. Modern investigative methods are of limited use.

An important subjective assessment during surgery is that affected brain tissue feels stiffer, however there is presently no way to determine this without committing to resecting the affected area. It is hypothesized that intra-operative use of a tonometer (Diaton) will identify abnormal brain tissue stiffness in affected brain relative to normal brain. This will help identify stiffer brain regions without having to resect them.

The objective is to determine if intra-operative use of a tonometer to measure brain tissue stiffness will offer additional precision in identifying epileptogenic lesions.

In participants with refractory epilepsy, various locations on the cerebral cortex will be identified using standard pre-operative investigations like magnetic resonance imagin (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). These are areas of presumed normal and abnormal brain where the tonometer will be used during surgery to measure brain tissue stiffness. Brain tissue stiffness measurements will then be compared with results of routine pre-operative and intra-operative tests. Such comparisons will help determine if and to what extent intra-operative brain tissue stiffness measurements correlate with other tests and help identify epileptogenic brain tissue.

24 participants have already undergone intra-operative brain tonometry. Results in these participants are encouraging: abnormally high brain tissue stiffness measurements have consistently been identified and significantly associated with abnormal brain tissue.

If the tonometer adequately identifies epileptogenic brain tissue through brain tissue stiffness measurements, it is possible that resection of identified tissue could lead to better post-operative outcomes, lowering seizure recurrences and neurological deficits.","Epilepsy|Focal Cortical Dysplasia|Tuberous Sclerosis|Hemimegalencephaly|Polymicrogyria|Rasmussen Encephalitis|Sturge-Weber Syndrome|Gliosis|Stroke|Tumor, Brain",DEVICE: Intra-operative brain tonometry,"Brain tissue stiffness measurements in mmHg as assessed by intraoperative use of a digital tonometer on presumed normal cerebral cortex, Brain tonometry is a novel diagnostic approach, therefore normal and abnormal brain tissue stiffness values are not known.

With this method, each brain tissue stiffness measurement can be compared to presence or absence of an underlying lesion on MRI; to presence or absence of epileptogenic foci on EEG; to presence of iso- or hypometabolism on PET; to presence or absence of epileptogenic foci on ECoG; to pathological diagnosis and severity of cortical disorganization on histopathological analysis.

- Epilepsy is a seizure disorder. Sometimes it is treated with surgery. During surgery, electrodes are placed on or in the brain. Researchers want to learn more about memory and the brain. They want to do tests on people who are having epilepsy surgery.

Objective:

- To learn more about memory and brain function by recording brain cell activity during memory tasks.

Eligibility:

- Adults age 18 - 65 who have medically intractable epilepsy and will have electrodes placed to identify the source of their seizures. They must be currently enrolled in protocol 11-N-0051.

Design:

* Participants may do memory tests before the electrodes are put in, while they are in place, and after surgery. Researchers may stimulate areas of the brain with small pulses of electricity.
* Researchers will start recording brain activity at least 12 hours after electrodes are placed. They will record while participants are awake and asleep. They will record before, during, and after seizures.
* Participants may have up to 3 testing sessions daily over the 1-3 weeks the electrodes are in place. Each session will last 20-60 minutes.
* Participants will play games on a laptop. Sometimes they may use a button or joystick. This can be done in bed in the hospital.
* Participants may be given a list of words and asked to recall them in a short time.
* Participants may be given pairs of items and asked to remember how they are related.
* Participants may be asked to learn their way around a virtual town on the computer. Their eye movements may be tracked by a small camera.",Epilepsy,,"to identify biomarkers of successful memory encoding and retrieval, We will compare brain recordings during memory encoding for items that are later recalled versus items that are not later recalled.

NCT00072813,MRI in Autosomal Dominant Partial Epilepsy With Auditory Features,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00072813,COMPLETED,"This study will examine the possible structural and functional abnormalities in patients with an inherited form of epilepsy. It will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Uncontrolled epilepsy is a serious neurological problem with major harmful medical, social, and psychological effects, as well as greater mortality compared with the general population. The cost per year in the United States is at least $12.5 billion. There have been advances in diagnosing the disease, but the cause cannot be determined in many cases. Recently, several seizure syndromes found in families have been described. One syndrome of particular interest involves the lateral temporal lobe of the brain and often includes auditory features. Patients with that kind of syndrome may hear monotonous unformed sounds, but sometimes they may hear complex sounds, such as a song.

Patients are eligible for this study if they have a specific form of familial epilepsy that is being studied at Columbia University in New York. Family members without seizures are eligible as well. All the patients in the study will be evaluated at Columbia before participating. Healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 also may be eligible for this study.

Participants will undergo a medical history and physical examination. During the study, they may have three or four sessions of MRI. During the MRI, patients will lie still on a table that can slide in and out of a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. Patients may be asked to lie still for up to 60 minutes at a time. As the scanner takes pictures, there will be loud knocking noises, and the patients will wear earplugs to muffle the sound. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the scan and may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. Some scans may be done in a 3 Tesla scanner. It is the latest advance in MRI, with a stronger magnetic field than in the more common 1.5 Tesla scanner. Functional MRI (fMRI) is done while patients are performing tasks, such as moving a limb or speaking. Patients will have an opportunity to practice such tasks before entering the scanner. The fMRI will take about 1 hour.

They will then undergo surgery. A small amount of tissue removed during surgery for pathological review will be collected for use in this study.

Half of the tissue will be examined using LSS to help determine the size of the cell and its nucleus. Studies will be done to measure how many of the cells are actively dividing and which proteins are expressed more often in tumor cells compared with normal cells.

NCT05014841,The Neural Coding of Speech Across Human Languages,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05014841,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"The overall goal of this study is to reveal the fundamental neural mechanisms that underlie comprehension across human spoken languages. An understanding of how speech is coded in the brain has significant implications for the development of new diagnostic and rehabilitative strategies for language disorders (e.g. aphasia, dyslexia, autism, et alia). The basic mechanisms underlying comprehension of spoken language are unknown. Researchers are only beginning to understand how the human brain extracts the most fundamental linguistic elements (consonants and vowels) from a complex and highly variable acoustic signal. Traditional theories have posited a 'universal' phonetic inventory shared by all humans, but this has been challenged by other newer theories that each language has its own unique and specialized code. An investigation of the cortical representation of speech sounds across languages can likely shed light on this fundamental question. Previous research has implicated the superior temporal cortex in the processing of speech sounds. Most of this work has been entirely carried out in English. The recording of neural activity directly from the cortical surface from individuals with different language experience is a promising approach since it can provide both high spatial and temporal resolution. This study will examine the mechanisms of phonetic encoding, by utilizing neurophysiological recordings obtained during neurosurgical procedures. High-density electrode arrays, advanced signal processing, and direct electrocortical stimulation will be utilized to unravel both local and population encoding of speech sounds in the lateral temporal cortex. This study will also examine the neural encoding of speech in patients who are monolingual and bilingual in Mandarin, Spanish, and English, the most common spoken languages worldwide, and feature important contrastive differences of pitch, formant, and temporal envelope. A cross-linguistic approach is critical for a true understanding of language, while also striving to achieve a broader approach of diversity and inclusion in neuroscience of language.",Epilepsy|Brain Tumor|Speech|Bilingualism,BEHAVIORAL: Speech Tasks,"Number of Participants with Electrocorticography (ECoG) Signals for Neural Activity Identified During Intraoperative Procedure or Inpatient Hospitalization, Number of participants with ECoG signals for neural activity identified during intraoperative procedure or inpatient hospitalization, between 10-30 minutes., Between 10-30 minutes","University of California, San Francisco","University of California, Berkeley|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|The University of Hong Kong|National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,52,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,4/19/2019,8/31/2024,"University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States"

The investigators will do this by testing epileptic patients who are already undergoing intracranial surgery for seizure monitoring, and measuring the activity from the brain areas being assessed.

The main questions it aims to answer are 1) whether scopolamine changes memory activity solely at encoding (the time when the person perceives and determines to remember an item or event) as has previously been found, or if it also can selectively impact retrieval (when the item or event which has been processed is recalled or remembered), and 2) what the nature of the brain activity changes is.

Participants will complete two treatment arms. One of these will be with the drug, and the other will be with a saline solution, so that the participants are unaware which session the actual drug has been received. Patients will complete a verbal and/or spatial task each of the two days. An anesthesiologist will administer either the drug or the saline at a critical point which addresses both of the research questions.

NCT00054990,Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs on Brain Excitability,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00054990,COMPLETED,"This study will evaluate the usefulness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in measuring cortical excitability. The cortex is the outer part of the brain. Patients with seizures have increased cortical excitability and are often treated with antiepileptic drugs to reduce this excitability. The therapeutic effects of antiepileptic drugs are usually tracked with blood tests that measure their blood levels. However, these blood tests may not always correctly reflect the effects of the drugs on the brain.

TMS has been used successfully to measure cortical excitability in many neurological diseases, including epilepsy, and may be helpful in measuring drug effects on the brain directly. For this procedure, a wire coil is held over the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. This may cause a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and twitching in muscles of the face, arm, or leg. During the stimulation, the participant may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions.

Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical and neurological examination, electroencephalogram (EEG), and blood tests.

On the first day of the study, participants will have a baseline TMS and will be randomly assigned to take one of two antiepileptic drugs: group A will take the carbamazepine; group B will take lamotrigine. If they wish, participants may be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for the first 5 days of drug administration while the proper dosage is being determined. They will then be discharged and continue taking the drug for a total of 36 days. During this time, they will have daily blood tests and TMS from days 2 through 5, and again on days 12 and 36. Group A will have additional blood sampling and TMS on days 37, 39, 44, and 53; Group B will have blood tests and TMS on days 38, 40, 45, and 53.",Healthy,,,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,40,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2003-02,,"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States"

Seizures may contribute to memory problems as well as other symptoms common in AD like agitation, depression, or apathy. These symptoms are collectively called neuro-psychiatric symptoms. Studies of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with AD have suggested that injury to certain parts of the brain can cause these neuro-psychiatric symptoms. Based on this evidence, the investigators hypothesize that seizures can also cause neuro-psychiatric symptoms in patients with AD and may be related to the injury seen on MRI.

The current study will follow participants for 1 year and will involve participants with AD who also have neuro-psychiatric symptoms. Participants will be examined with three brain wave studies to assess for seizure-like activity. Participants with seizure-like activity will all receive levetiracetam for 1 year. All participants will have their neuro-psychiatric symptoms, cognitive abilities, quality of life, and AD severity assessed throughout the year. The investigators plan to determine if levetiracetam changes the severity of the participants' neuro-psychiatric symptoms compared to their baseline as well as compared to participants without seizure-like activity. 65 participants will need to be recruited to test the study hypotheses.

The investigators will test a new method for recording EEG which uses a novel dry electrode system headset that does not require an EEG technologist to operate. The headset integrates the EEG electrodes and amplifier into a compact system which is easily placed on the head. This approach could make it possible for a nurse or nurse assistant with minimal training to record an EEG in a rural community based outpatient clinic (CBOC) as part of an epilepsy telemedicine outreach program along with clinical interviews. The investigators will compare performance of this dry electrode system to standard EEG when it is used by EEG technologists in three VA medical centers.

To support this study and become a participant, we ask that you register in the CMDIR. You can do this by visiting www.cmdir.org. There is no travel required.

The registry includes affected individuals with congenital muscular dystrophy, congenital myopathy, and congenital myasthenic syndrome and registers through the late onset spectrum for these disease groups. The CMDIR was created to identify the global congenital muscle disease population for the purpose of raising awareness, standards of care, clinical trials and in the future a treatment or cure. Simply put, we will not be successful in finding a treatment or cure unless we know who the affected individuals are, what the diagnosis is and how the disease is affecting the individual.

Registering in the CMDIR means that you will enter demographic information and complete an intake survey. We would then ask that you provide records regarding the diagnosis and treatment of CMD, including genetic testing, muscle biopsy, pulmonary function testing, sleep studies, clinic visit notes, and hospital discharge summaries.

Study hypothesis:

1. To use patient and proxy reported survey answers and medical reports to build a longitudinal care and outcomes database across the congenital muscle diseases.
2. To generate congenital muscle disease subtype specific adverse event rates and correlate with key care parameters.","Congenital Muscular Dystrophy With ITGA7 (Integrin Alpha-7) Deficiency|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and Abnormal Glycosylation of Dystroglycan With Severe Epilepsy)|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (Congenital Muscular Dystrophy With Fatty Liver and Infantile-onset Cataract Caused by TRAPPC11 Mutations)|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (Congenital Muscular Dystrophy With Hypoglycosylation of Dystroglycan)|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (Congenital Muscular Dystrophy With Hypoglycosylation of Dystroglycan and Epilepsy)|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (Dystroglycanopathy, Congenital With or Without Mental Retardation (Formerly MDC1C))|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (Fukuyama CMD)|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (LGMDR09 FKRP Related (Formerly LGMD2I))|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (LGMDR11 POMT1 Related (Formerly LGMD2K))|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (LGMDR13 FKTN Related (Formerly LGMD2M))|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (LGMDR14 POMT2 Related (Formerly LGMD2N))|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (LGMDR15 POMGnT1 Related (Formerly LGMD2O))|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (LGMDR19 GMPPB Related (Formerly LGMD2T))|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (LGMDR20 ISPD Related (Formerly LGMD2U))|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (LGMDR24 POMGnT2 Related)|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (Muscle Eye Brain Disease (MEB))|Alpha-Dystroglycanopathy (Walker Warburg Syndrome (WWS))|Choline Kinase B Receptor - CHKB|Collagen VI Related Disorders|Collagen XII Related Disorders|Congenital Muscular Dystrophy Not Otherwise Specified (Including Merosin Positive)|Congenital Muscular Dystrophy With Cataracts and Intellectual Disability (MDCCAID)|Congenital Muscular Dystrophy With Joint Hyperlaxity|Congenital Muscular Dystrophy With Rigid Spine Related to ACTA1|Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy|GOLGA2-related Congenital Muscle Dystrophy With Brain Involvement|LMNA Related Disorders|Merosin Deficient CMD (Full or Partial)|Nesprin Related MD (SYNE1)|SELENON Related Disorders (Previously Known as SEPN1)|SELENON Related Myopathy (Aka SEPN1)|Telethonin CMD|Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome|Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy|LGMDD01 - DNAJB6 (Formerly LGMD1D)|LGMDD05 - Collagen VI Related Bethlem Myopathy (Dominant)|LGMDR07 - Telethonin (TCAP) Related (Formerly LGMD2G)|LGMDR08 - TRIM Related (Formerly LGMD2H)|LGMDR09 - FKRP Related (Formerly LGMD2I)|LGMDR10 - Titin (TTN) Related (Formerly LGMD2J)|LGMDR11 - POMT1 Related (Formerly LGMD2K)|LGMDR13 - Fukutin (FKTN) Related (Formerly LGMD2M)|LGMDR14 - POMT2 Related (Formerly LGMD2N)|LGMDR15 - POMGnT1 Related (Formerly LGMD2O)|LGMDR16 - DAG1 Related Dystroglycanopathy (Formerly LGMD2P)|LGMDR17 - Plectin (PLEC) Related (Formerly LGMD2Q)|LGMDR18 - TRAPPC11 Related (Formerly LGMD2S)|LGMDR19 - GMPPB Related (Formerly LGMD2T)|LGMDR20 - ISPD Related (Formerly LGMD2U)|LGMDR22 - Collagen VI Related Bethlem Myopathy (Recessive)|LGMDR23 - LAMA2 Related|LGMDR24 - POMGnT2 Related",,"Congenital Muscle Disease Patient and Proxy Reported Outcomes, Correlation between genetic and biopsy findings and their relation to phenotypic and adverse event data., 10 years",Cure CMD,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,4000,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2009-09,2029-09,"Congenital Muscle Disease International Registry (www.cmdir.org), Lakewood, California, 90712, United States"

However, there is both published evidence for first-line use (infantile spasms, Glut1 deficiency syndrome) and also anecdotal experience (families choosing to change the child's (or the family' own) diet rather than use anticonvulsant medications). Childhood absence epilepsy (refractory) has been published as being responsive to ketogenic diet therapy by the investigators' group previously. This is a small, prospective, 3 month trial to assess if using a modified Atkins diet is a feasible and effective option for new-onset childhood absence epilepsy.

The aims of this project are:

* To characterize the natural history of DRPLA in both juvenile- and adult-onset patients and study different modalities of biomarkers in this condition.
* To identify genetic factors and biomarkers that could predict disease progression.
* To provide a platform to support the design and conduct of clinical trials.

This study has three arms:

1. Adult Participants: this arm of the study will require participants to be 16 years old or over to participate.
2. Pediatric Participants: this arm of the study will require participants to be under 16 years old to participate.
3. Remote Participants: patients that cannot or do not wish to travel to one of the study sites can participate in this arm of the study, irrespective of their age.

Participants will have an annual visit for three years (baseline visit and two follow-up visits, three visits in total). Subjects who complete the whole protocol will be assessed on two consecutive days to reduce patient burden.

NCT01496612,Buspirone Therapy for Localized Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01496612,TERMINATED,"Background:

Buspirone is a drug that is approved for the treatment of anxiety in adults. Studies suggest that buspirone might act on parts of the brain that can increase certain levels of brain activity. Increasing this brain activity may help decrease epileptic seizures that come from certain parts of the brain. Researchers want to see if buspirone can reduce seizure frequency in people with seizures who are already taking antiseizure medication.

Objectives:

To test whether buspirone can reduce the frequency of seizures in people whose seizures seem to start from one part of the brain.

Eligibility:

Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have seizures coming from one or more places in the brain.

Participants must have tried at least two different antiseizure medications.

Participants must also have had at least three seizures during a 1-month observation period while on current medicines.

Design:

Participants will have a screening visit with a physical exam and medical history. Participants will complete mood and memory testing scales. Blood, urine, and saliva samples will be collected.

Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging scan to evaluate brain structures that relate to epilepsy. They will also have a positron emission tomography scan to look at parts of the brain that are affected by buspirone.

Participants will start taking a study drug (either buspirone or placebo) twice daily. They will keep a calendar of seizures and record any side effects. Treatment will be monitored with clinic visits and blood samples.

After 12 weeks on the study drug, participants will gradually stop taking either the placebo or buspirone over two weeks. They will stay off the drug for another 2 weeks.

After 2 weeks, participants will start taking a study drug that is the opposite of the one they had before. They will keep a calendar of seizures and record any side effects. Treatment will be monitored with clinic visits and blood samples.

After 12 weeks on the study drug, participants will gradually stop taking either the placebo or buspirone.

Participants will have a final followup visit with additional blood tests, mood and memory testing scales and imaging studies.",Anxiety Disorder|Seizures|Epilepsy|Partial Epilepsy|Depression,DRUG: Buspirone|DRUG: Placebo,"Seizure Frequency in the Buspirone (Active) and Placebo Periods, Participants utilized a seizure calendar to record the number of seizures that occurred during the three month treatment period, i.e., while participants were either taking Buspirone or Placebo.

TMS used in this study is intended to lessen the number of seizures a patient has by decreasing excitability of the brain in the region where the seizures originate.

Patients between 5 and 65 years of age who have had epilepsy for two or more years and have had at least one seizure a week for at least 6 months may be eligible for this 18-week study. Their seizures must come from a neocortical focus-that is, near the surface of the brain. Candidates will be selected from the NIH Epilepsy clinic and will be screened with an electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and blood tests.

Participants will keep a diary of the seizures they experience over an 8-week period. After the 8 weeks, they will come to the NIH outpatient clinic for 6 consecutive days for the following procedures:

* Day 1: A regular clinic visit, plus 6 hours of video-EEG recording (described below)
* Days 2 through 5: Video-EEG monitoring and TMS as follows:

8:00 - 11: 00 a.m. 3 hours video-EEG monitoring

11:00 - 12:30 p.m. TMS (includes set-up time; actual stimulation time lasts 30 minutes)

12:30 - 3:00 p.m. Lunch + rest

3:00 - 4:30 p.m. TMS

4:30 - 7:30 p.m. 3 hours video-EEG monitoring

(On the fifth day, subjects will have 6 hours of video-EEG monitoring in the afternoon instead of 3 hours.)

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two TMS groups. One group will have TMS delivered in a way that is thought to have a chance of reducing seizures; the other will have sham, or placebo, stimulation.

When the TMS sessions are completed, participants will keep a diary of their seizures for another 8 weeks.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

For TMS, an insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small electrical currents in the cortex, or outer part of the brain. The stimulation may cause muscle, hand or arm twitching, or may cause twitches or temporary tingling in the forearm, head, or face muscles. During the stimulation, electrical activity of muscles is recorded with a computer or other recording device, using electrodes attached to the skin with tape. Some TMS sessions may be videotaped.

NCT05876910,Neural Mechanisms for Stopping Ongoing Speech Production,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05876910,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"Speech and communication disorders often result in aberrant control of the timing of speech production, such as making improper stops at places where they should not be. During normal speech, the ability to stop when necessary is important for maintaining turn-taking in a smooth conversation. Existing studies have largely investigated neural circuits that support the preparation and generation of speech sounds. It is believed that activity in the prefrontal and premotor cortical areas facilitates high-level speech control and activity in the ventral part of the sensorimotor cortex controls the articulator (e.g. lip, jaw, tongue) movements. However, little is known about the neural mechanism controlling a sudden and voluntary stop of speech. Traditional view attributes this to a disengagement of motor signals while recent evidence suggested there may be an inhibitory control mechanism. This gap in knowledge limits our understanding of disorders like stuttering and aphasia, where deficits in speech timing control are among the common symptoms. The overall goal of this study is to determine how the brain controls the stopping of ongoing speech production to deepen our understanding of speech and communication in normal and impaired conditions.",Epilepsy|Speech,BEHAVIORAL: Speech Production Tasks,"Mean Change in Neural Activity, The mean change in neural activity is calculated as the average change in neural activity across trials between a time period (\~1 second) after the visual cue and a time period (\~1 second) before the visual cue.

Patients with partial epilepsy commonly have changes in their breathing mechanisms during seizures. These changes may increase the risk of serious side effects from seizures, including sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which affects 2-10 per 1000 patients with epilepsy each year. Fluoxetine (Prozac) may help to stimulate breathing through its actions in the brain and has been shown to improve breathing changes seen with seizures in certain animals. Fluoxetine is in a class of medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It works by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain, at synapses, the junctions at which nerve cells in the brain communicate.

However, for most patients IIS is the only presenting clinical feature and the specific cause is unknown. Only two FDA approved pharmacologic treatments for IIS exist, Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and vigabatrin. While vigabatrin may be the treatment of choice for Tuberous Sclerosis as a cause for IS, ACTH is the treatment of choice for all others. Unfortunately, a substantial number of patients may still not respond to ACTH and there is no a priori way that suggests which patients may be responders. This has led to the following key questions:

Can novel genetic analyses determine known genetic causes of IS with greater efficiency (more timely and cost-effective)? Can novel genetic analyses determine previously unknown disease modifying genes that predispose individuals to develop IS? Can novel genetic analyses elaborate genes and gene polymorphisms that favor ACTH responsiveness? Do these polymorphisms suggest strategies to improve ACTH responsiveness?",Infantile Spasms,,"Determine the effectiveness of novel genetic analyses in suggesting disease-modifying genes that may contribute to triggering IIS., Apply novel genetic analyses to determine possible causes of cryptogenic IIS and evaluate adding novel genetic analyses to standard practice for determining causes of IIS, Results of the DNA studies will be evaluated prior to completion of the 5th year to assess the need for further investigations.","University of Colorado, Denver",,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",,63,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2013-03,3/9/2017,"Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States"

NCT00439387,The Role of Serotonin in Seizures,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00439387,TERMINATED,"This study will investigate the role that a brain chemical called serotonin plays in seizures. Serotonin, present naturally in the brain, helps transmit signals between nerve cells. Glucose is a sugar that is the main fuel of the brain. Studying these two chemicals may help explain why people with epilepsy get seizures and are more likely to be depressed.

Healthy volunteers and patients 18 to 60 years of age who have epilepsy with or without depression and whose seizures are not controlled by medication may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a review of their medical history, a physical examination and an electroencephalogram (EEG, brain wave recording).

Participants undergo the following procedures:

* Positron emission tomography (PET) scans: The first of three PET scans measures brain blood flow and the activity at some of the brain serotonin receptors (the parts of brain cells to which serotonin attaches). A second scan measures the amount of serotonin transported between brain cells. A third scan measures glucose use. The PET scanner is shaped like a doughnut. The subject lies on a bed that slides in and out of the scanner with his or her head inside the opening. A special mask is fitted to the subject s head to help keep it still during the procedure so the images will be clear. For the first scan, catheters (plastic tubes) are placed in an arm vein to inject a radioactive substance and in an artery in the wrist to collect blood samples. The other two scans require only the catheter in the arm.
* Magnetic resonance imaging: This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain. The scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. The subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder. Most scans last between 45 and 90 minutes. Subjects wear earplugs to muffle loud knocking noises that occur during scanning.
* Psychological evaluation: Subjects are interviewed and fill out questionnaires to help study sadness and depression in epilepsy.

Also, millions of patients do not respond to current medications or psychotherapy, which makes it critical to find an alternative therapy. Applying electrical stimulation at various brain targets has shown promise but there is a critical need to improve efficacy.

Given inter- and intra-subject variabilities in neuropsychiatric disorders, this study aims to enable personalizing the stimulation therapy via i) tracking a patient's own symptoms based on their neural activity, and ii) a model of how their neural activity responds to stimulation therapy. The study will develop the modeling elements needed to realize a model-based personalized closed-loop system for electrical brain stimulation to achieve this aim.

Many people take ginkgo biloba to improve memory, mental alertness and overall feeling of well being. Since this product is considered a food supplement and not a drug, it is not subject to the rigorous pre-market testing required for prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. As a result, information has not been collected on possible interactions between ginkgo biloba and other medications. This study will look at how ginkgo biloba affects the elimination of phenytoin-a medication used to treat patients with seizures.

The supratemporal plane, comprised of Heschl's gyrus, the planum polare, and the planum temporale, is capable of the rapid spectrotemporal analysis required to map acoustic information to linguistic representation. Neural activity in this area, however, is rarely studied directly because it is difficult to access with non-invasive measures like scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Capitalizing on the unique opportunity to access these areas via routine clinical stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) in a patient population, this study seeks to understand how cortical responses reflect the diagnosticity of two acoustic-phonetic dimensions of interest and how responses rapidly and flexibly adapt to changes in listening demands. Examining how neural response to voice onset time (VOT) and fundamental frequency (F0) modulates as a function of perceptual weight carried in signaling phoneme categories, and identifying how changes in listening context shift perceptual weight, will provide invaluable data that indicates how speech processing flexibly adapts to short-term acoustic patterns.",Epilepsy,BEHAVIORAL: Dimension-Based Statistical Learning,"Supratemporal Neural Response to Change in Acoustic-Phonetic Dimensions, Neural activity will be measured via simultaneous EEG-sEEG monitoring in the supratemporal plane as indicated by high-gamma band activity in the electrical signal.

NCT00524134,P-glycoprotein Inhibition as Adjunct Treatment for Medically Refractory Epilepsy.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00524134,TERMINATED,"In up to 1 out of 3 patients with epilepsy, seizures continue to occur despite the use of one or more antiepileptic medications. Patients also have significant problems with side-effects of these medications as doses are increased.

Our body naturally generates miniature pumps located on the surfaces of many organs to get rid of toxic substances, and antiepileptic medications can be considered by the cells of the body to be a toxin. Research with epileptic brain regions have shown an increase in the amount of drug pumps, therefore getting rid of antiepileptic drugs. One of these pumps is called p-glycoprotein (P-gp for short). Medications may be unable to penetrate and stay within the parts of the brain that need them them most. This may mean that the amount of drug is actually lower in the parts of the brain that cause seizures, and higher in the rest of the brain, which may be why patients may still feel side-effects when seizures are still occurring.

Research in animals has shown that blocking the P-gp pumps can improve how bad, and how many seizures occur as well as the length of seizures. Blockage of the pumps can be done using a different type of medication. Some medications that are used for common problems have been discovered to also block P-gp pumps. One of these, carvedilol, is used to treat heart failure and high blood pressure. It has been found to be very safe in these patients, and does not have a lot of side-effects. We plan to add this medication in addition to patient's anti-seizure medications to see if it will improve epileptic seizures.

The reason why some patients have high amounts of P-gp pumps and others do not may be related to their genetics. A simple blood test can be used to determine a person's potential to produce high quantities of the pumps. This study will also attempt to show that the genetics will affect how well the P-gp blocking will work.",Epilepsy,DRUG: Carvedilol-CR,"Proportion of Each Treatment Arm With ≥50% Reduction in Seizures, 12 weeks at highest tolerated dose",Columbia University,American Epilepsy Society|Milken Institute|GlaxoSmithKline,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2|PHASE3,6,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2008-12,2010-10,"Columbia Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, New York, New York, 10032, United States"

Patients with Lafora disease have rapid neurological deterioration with myoclonus (brief muscle jerks), seizures and mental decline. At present there is no treatment to halt disease progression.

Patients 10 years of age and older with relatively advanced Lafora disease may be eligible for this study. Participants will be admitted to the Clinical Center for the first 4 weeks of this 6-month study for baseline testing and to start the ketogenic diet. They will have a complete medical history and physical examination, plus a detailed neurological examination and blood and urine tests. Procedures include:

* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans to provide information about brain chemistry
* Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to analyze chemicals in cerebrospinal fluid
* Metabolic and endocrinological tests, including a glucose tolerance test, to evaluate the body's response to a large intake of oral glucose
* Standard neuropsychological tests
* Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain and muscle
* Electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain wave activity
* Electromyography (EMG) to measure muscle activity
* Evoked potentials (SEP and VEP) to study brain responses to mild electric or visual stimulation.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (magnetic stimulation of the brain) may also be done to study the function of the brain cortex (outer nervous tissue of the brain) and the effects of treatment on brain excitability.

The ketogenic diet will begin after the tests are completed. The diet provides mainly fats to fuel the body, plus the recommended amount of protein and minimum carbohydrate. Vitamin and mineral supplements are provided to meet daily requirements. After 2 weeks on the diet, the patient will be discharged from the hospital and seen daily as an outpatient for another 1 to 2 weeks. During this time the patient or caregiver is trained in preparing the ketogenic diet, and then the patient is discharged to home. Throughout the study, disease symptoms will be assessed using standardized rating scales. Blood and urine tests will be done as needed, as will follow-up brain imaging, neuropsychological and neurophysiological evaluations.

A skin and/or muscle biopsy may be done at the first clinic visit to grow skin cells in culture and to analyze the skin and muscle under a microscope. The biopsy area is numbed with an anesthetic and a small piece of tissue is removed either with a needle, an instrument similar to a cookie-cutter or a knife. The skin cells may be used for metabolic studies and to obtain DNA for genetic testing.

At the end of the study, patients who responded well to the treatment with no significant adverse side effects may continue the diet for another 12 months.

-People with seizures benefit from regular exercise. Exercise may help decrease the number of seizures they have. It also improves overall health and quality of life. However, people with seizure disorders often have been prevented from doing sports or other regular physical activity. They may also feel that exercise or injury can increase their risk of seizures. Researchers want to try an exercise program for people who have seizures to see if they can increase motivation to exercise which will improve overall health and may decrease the frequency of seizures.

Objectives:

- To see how exercise education improves motivation to exercise in people who have a history of seizures.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a history of seizures.

Design:

* This study involves three outpatient visits and weekly telephone calls for about 12 weeks. There will be followup calls at about 6 and 12 months after the outpatient visits.
* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will answer questions about their current level of physical activity, mood, quality of life, and ideas about exercise.
* At the first visit, participants will learn how to keep a physical activity log and seizure calendar. They will also use an activity monitor and take their pulse regularly. They will complete questionnaires about their mood and thoughts about exercise and seizures.
* At the second visit, participants will set personal activity goals and learn about physical activity and seizures. They will review the physical activity log, seizure log, and activity monitor and pulse readings for the previous 4 weeks.
* After the second visit, participants will receive weekly telephone calls. Each call will last about 5 minutes. These calls will ask about physical activities for the week and participants' progress toward meeting their goals. These calls will also review the seizure log.
* At the third visit (12 weeks), the same tests from the first visit will be repeated.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study will compare ezogabine/retigabine IR (investigator-selected daily doses of 600 milligram (mg)/day, 750 mg/day, 900 mg/day, 1050 mg/day or 1200 mg/day) with placebo. Study drug will be taken three times a day (TID) in equally or unequally divided doses.

The study design includes up to a 10-week (wk) Screening (≤2 wks)/Baseline (8 wks) Phase, a Titration Phase (2 wks), Dose-Optimization Phase (8 wks), Maintenance Phase (8 wks), and Taper/Follow-Up Phase (3 wks). The total duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 31 wks, and at minimum approximately 27 wks if subjects provide reliable 28-day retrospective seizure data.

Approximately 280 subjects will be screened with approximately 208 subjects randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio (ezogabine/retigabine IR, or placebo).

Subjects will be instructed to start investigational product (IP) the day after the baseline visit. During the first week of the Titration Phase, subjects will be taking 300 mg/day (100 mg TID). During the second week, subjects will be taking 450 mg/day (150 mg/day TID).

At the beginning of the Dose-Optimization Phase (3rd week of study drug) subjects will take 600 mg/day (200 mg TID) for one week. Thereafter during the Dose-Optimization Phase, subjects will continue to increase their daily dose by 150 mg per week until they have achieved their optimal tolerated dose. During this phase, the investigator may choose to have the subject stay on his/her designated dose for another week before attempting a dose increase until reaching a dose of 1200 mg/day. In addition, in the context of tolerability issues, the subject may be reduced to the preceding dose level for one week before attempting to increase the dose again at the next scheduled time point until the subject reaches optimal dose. Subjects unable to tolerate a minimum of 600 mg/day will be discontinued from the study.

The Maintenance Phase will begin at Week 10 (Visit 8) and will last 8 weeks. During the Maintenance Phase, subjects will remain on the daily TID dose achieved at the end of the Dose-Optimization Phase.

Pilot data shows that GABA(A) binding potential and glutamate utilization are tightly coupled in healthy subjects particularly in the mesial temporal lobe. We hypothesize that subjects with epilepsy will not exhibit the same degree of coupling, and that subjects with both epilepsy and depression will exhibit an even more pronounced decoupling.

Study Population: Subjects aged 18-55 with localization-related epilepsy with and without depression, subjects with generalized epilepsy, subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) alone, and healthy controls.

Design: This is a neuroimaging study, using positron emission tomography (PET) with \[11C\]flumazenil, to measure GABA(A) binding potential, and \[18F\]fluorodeoxyglucose, to measure glucose utilization (reflective of neuronal glutamate release) Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), will be used to measure GABA and glutamate in the mesial temporal cortex, and corroborate the PET results. Structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) will be obtained for MRS localization and partial volume correction of PET images.

The exact mechanism of SUDEP is not known. It is thought that cardiac and respiratory factors are involved. Several ways of preventing SUDEP have been identified. These include seizure control, stress reduction, physical activity, family's ability to perform CPR, and night supervision.

A mattress alarm system that monitors nocturnal seizures can alert family members of night time seizure activity. Thus, a family member could provide aid and therefore potentially avoid SUDEP. The Emfit monitor is intended to perform these tasks.

Investigators tested the Emfit mattress monitor DVM-GPRS-V2 in combination with the Emfit bed sensor L-4060SL in the epilepsy monitoring unit and were able to demonstrate that the device has a high predictive value for detection of generalized convulsions and that it can notify caregivers in the early stages of convulsive activity.

However, the next set of questions await pertaining to the sequencing of those auditory elements and how they are integrated with other features, such as, the amplitude envelope of speech. Further investigation of the cortical representation of speech sounds can likely shed light on these fundamental questions. Previous research has implicated the superior temporal cortex in the processing of speech sounds, but little is known about how these sounds are linked together into the perceptual experience of words and continuous speech.

NCT00965575,Pilot Study of Melatonin and Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00965575,COMPLETED,"The prevalence of epilepsy is 1% in the USA. About 30% of epilepsy patients eventually become refractory to medical treatment. Co morbid conditions are becoming as important as seizure control as these affect overall wellbeing. Sleep related complaints are frequent in them including, frequent arousals, difficulty falling asleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography shows increased arousal index, sleep onset latency, and stage shifts and fragmented REM sleep. Poor sleep efficiency causes daytime fatigue, poor cognition and behavior and can worsen seizure control. Stabilizing sleep may improve seizure control. Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone in the body involved in the regulation of circadian rhythm and exogenously given, has been shown to decrease sleep onset latency, arousals, and there-by increase sleep efficiency in healthy pediatric patients. Similar data does not exist in the patients with epilepsy. As sleep has important impact on epilepsy and overall functioning, it is important to study effect of melatonin in children with epilepsy.

We propose a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial with a cross-over design. Our hypothesis is that, for patients with epilepsy, administration of melatonin 30 minutes before bedtime for four weeks may:

* Improve the quality of sleep;
* Improve daytime functioning in terms of cognition, behavior and quality of life;
* Decrease epileptic potential. We will use polysomnography, electroencephalogram, psychomotor vigilance task, seizure diary, and questionnaires to assess the effect of melatonin on these domains.

Questionnaires or simple behavioral tasks (game-like tasks on a computer or an iPad) may also be given to additionally characterize subjects on related cognitive or affective components. Importantly, for the purposes of understanding the function of the human brain, neural activity can be recorded and probed (i.e. microstimulation) while subjects are performing the same computerized cognitive and affective tasks. These surgeries allow for the in vivo examination of human neurophysiology and are a rare opportunity for such research.

In addition to computerized testing, the investigators plan to characterize subjects' behavior on related cognitive or affective components. Some neuropsychological questionnaires, many of which are administered for clinical reasons (listed below under study population), may also be given to patients and healthy control subjects.

All patients undergoing epilepsy surgery (the population from which subjects will be selected) undergo a standard clinical neuropsychological battery to assess aspects of cognitive function. This is a regular aspect of their clinical assessment carried out prior to consideration for study inclusion.

NCT01566500,Medication Adherence in Individuals With Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01566500,COMPLETED,"There is an urgent need to understand the psychological and situational factors that influence medication adherence in individuals with epilepsy. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2010) about 2.5 million people in the United States have epilepsy and one third of them still have seizures despite receiving treatment. With proper medication, an estimated 60-70% of individuals with new onset epilepsy become, and remain, seizure free (Kwan \& Brodie, 2000). Despite the success of medical treatment of epilepsy, many patients do not receive these benefits due to inadequate adherence to medication (Meyer et al., 2010). And, as with other chronic medical conditions, estimates suggest that between 30% and 60% of patients with epilepsy are not adherent with their drug regimens (Green \& Simons Morton, 1988; Leppik, 1990; Jones et al., 2006). Poor adherence may be the most important cause of poorly controlled epilepsy (Gomes et al., 1998). Stanaway et al. (1985) found that 31% of seizures were precipitated by nonadherence to medication.

Questions regarding adherence are theoretically informed by Fisher et al. (2006)'s Information Motivation Behavioral Skills (IMB) model. While originally developed to describe, predict, and inform interventions for antiretroviral treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), this study applies the model to epilepsy for the first time. In addition, this study intends to produce an accurate description of how individuals with epilepsy manage their medication adherence by identifying current self regulation strategies (immediate adherence behaviors, preparatory behaviors, and barrier management strategies) and their situational determinants. Situational determinants can explain some of the fluctuations in medication adherence. Patients who are motivated to take their medications might still show inconsistent medication adherence. For example, patients might miss good opportunities to take their medication or fail to anticipate unexpected barriers such as a spontaneous dinner with friends or a bout of depression. Therefore, the study will take particular care to investigate situational cues such as good opportunities for adherence (e.g., taking medication with regular meals or before brushing teeth) and expected and unexpected barriers. Preparatory behaviors and their cues are also of interest in this study: Some patients use facilitators (such as physical or electronic reminder systems, electronic pill bottles and pill boxes) to ensure adequate medication adherence. Social support can serve a similar function of reminding patients to take their medication. To address these questions, the investigators plan to explore how individual regulation and social support influence medication adherence in patients with epilepsy. The specific aims of the proposed research are:

1. To test the hypothesis that there will be a main effect of information, motivation and behavioral skills, on adherence behavior, and that a mediation model will show that information and motivation effects are partially mediated through behavioral skills.
2. To identify self regulation strategies and their situational cues (good opportunities, facilitators, and barriers) for medication adherence among individuals with epilepsy to better describe best practices and challenges.",Epilepsy,,"Raw Count of Number of Days of Medication Nonadherence, The primary outcome of this study is medication adherence as measured by self report with a 4 day recall adherence questionnaire (Chesney, Ickovics, Chambers, et al., 2000).

NCT03502759,Improving Patient Communication About SUDEP,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03502759,COMPLETED,"Children with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) have about a 1 in 4500 of succumbing to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). For that reason, the American Academy of Neurology recommends that clinicians caring for these children make their families aware of this small but important risk and provide appropriate supportive follow-up resources. Moreover, existing evidence suggests that children with poorly controlled GTCS have a strikingly increased odds of SUDEP, 3-24 fold, raising the importance of improving seizure control.

Clinicians caring for these patients have multiple issues to address in the typical visit. The investigators propose to use information technology to help providers assure that addressing SUDEP is incorporated into their routine care. The investigators have developed the Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation system (CHICA), a computer based clinical decision support system for pediatric care. CHICA captures patient reported data in the waiting room and prioritizes clinical advice to the physician through the electronic health record (EHR).

CHICA is used in five primary care clinics in the Eskenazi health system where it supports general pediatric care.

NCT02950506,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Cognitive Remediation Therapy for Interictal Dysfunction in Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02950506,WITHDRAWN,"The purpose of this study is to investigate whether tDCS enhances the effect of cognitive remediation therapy on cognition and functional outcome in patients with epilepsy. There has been evidence that working memory performance is enhanced in healthy subjects. Acute tDCS studies have found improvements in working memory performance in subjects with other neurological diseases. To date, there have been no published studies examining whether can enhance learning during multi-session cognitive remediation over 2 weeks in subjects with epilepsy. This study could have potential application as a non-invasive clinical intervention for interictal dysfunction in epilepsy.",Epilepsy,DEVICE: transcranial direct current stimulation|OTHER: Cognitive Remediation Therapy,"Cogstate Brief Battery, The Cogstate Battery is a computerized cognitive assessment program which measures a wide

range of cognitive functions (e.g. psychomotor speed, reaction time, working memory, divided

attention, learning), which can be repeated with little to none observed practice effects (Falleti

2006). All tasks within the battery were adaptations of standard neuro-psychological and

experimental psychological tests. Time to administer requires approximately 15-20 minutes

consists of 8 tasks in the form of card games that are presented in succession., Change from baseline to 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after last intervention visit.|Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) is a measure of immediate auditory and verbal

memory as well as delayed recall. Participants are given a list of 15 unrelated words repeated

over five different trials and are asked to repeat. Another list of 15 unrelated words are given and

the client must again repeat the original list of 15 words and then again after 30 minutes.

Approximately 45-50 minutes is required for the procedure. (Loring et al. 2008, Strauss 2006), Change from baseline to 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after last intervention visit.|Picture Sequence Memory Test, The Picture Sequence Memory Test (PSMT) is a measure for use in the assessment of episodic

memory. Participants are asked to recall, in increasing length, a series of illustrated objects and

activities that are presented in a particular order on the computer screen. The participants are

asked to recall the sequence of pictures that is demonstrated over two learning trials. The number

of pictures may vary depending on the age. The test takes approximately 7 minutes to administer.

(Dikmen et al. 2014), Change from baseline to 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after last intervention visit.|Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Task, This task measures both a participant's attention and inhibitory control. The test requires the

participant to focus on a given arrow while inhibiting attention to other arrows surrounding it.

(Heaton et al. 2014) Sometimes the middle stimulus is pointing in the same direction as the

""flankers"" (congruent) and sometimes in the opposite direction (incongruent). Scoring is based

on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. The test takes approximately 3 minutes to

administer., Change from baseline to 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after last intervention visit.|Dimensional Change Card Sort Test, DCCS is an assessment to measure of cognitive flexibility. Two target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension(e.g., shape). ""Switch"" trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched. For example, after 4 straight trials matching on shape,the participant may be asked to match on color on the next trial and then go back to shape, thus requiring the cognitive flexibility to quickly choose the correct stimulus. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. This test takes approximately 4 minutes to administer., Change from baseline to 5 days, 1 month, and 3 months after last intervention visit.",University of Minnesota,,ALL,ADULT,NA,0,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE",1/1/2020,3/1/2020,"University of Minnesota Comprehensive Epilepsy Center(MINCEP), Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, 55416, United States"

NCT00071370,Activating Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Synchronized MEG-EEG Recordings of Epilepsy Patients With Non-Diagnostic EEG,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00071370,COMPLETED,"This study will evaluate how the state of being completely deprived of sleep has an effect on recordings of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), in relation to how alert someone is and how sleepy someone perceives himself or herself to be. EEG measures electronic potential differences on the scalp. On the other hand, MEG is a non-invasive technique for recording the activity of neurons in the brain, through recording of magnetic fields caused by synchronized neural currents. It has the ability to detect seizures. Because magnetic signals of the brain vary, this technique must balance two key problems: weakness of the signal and strength of the noise. The EEG is sensitive to extra-cellular volume currents, whereas the MEG primarily registers intra-cellular currents. Because electrical fields are quite dependent on the conductive properties of the tissues, and magnetic fields are significantly less distorted by tissue, the MEG has better spatial resolution. There is a great deal of evidence that EEG and MEG provide complementary data about underlying currents of ions.

The complex relationship of sleep and epilepsy is well known. Sleep has been used for many years as a powerful EEG activator. Many researchers have supported the hypothesis that there is a specific activating effect of sleep deprivation on epileptic discharges. Sleep deprivation is defined as a sleepless state of longer than 24 hours. The increased use of MEG in diagnosis could improve the procedure for evaluating patients before surgery for epilepsy, by making invasive studies less necessary.

Patients 18 years of age or older, with a diagnosis of epilepsy and with a documented last routine EEG (at least 2 weeks earlier) and routine EEG on the day of a baseline MEG-EEG without interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) may be eligible for this study.

Participants will be rated according to the Epworth, Stanford, and Karolinska Sleepiness Scales, to determine their subjective sleepiness. They will be randomly assigned to stay awake all night or sleep in the hospital overnight. That is, a sleep deprivation and non-sleep deprivation synchronized MEG-EEG recording will be performed in random order. Then the sequence of sleep deprivation and non-sleep deprivation will be reversed within 14 to 21 days. During the recordings, the patient will either sit or lie with his or her head in a helmet covering the entire head, with openings for the eyes and ears. Brain magnetic fields will be recorded with a 275-channel OMEGA system. Throughout the session, visual and two-way audio communication will be maintained with the patient. Recording sessions will last 90 to 180 minutes, with the patient allowed to take breaks after at least 10 minutes in a scanner. Attempts will be made to encourage patients to stay awake and sleep for about the same amount of time during each recording, to acquire comparable amounts of sleep and awake recordings.",Epilepsy,,,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,25,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2003-10,,"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States"

NCT01281956,PRX-00023 Therapy in Localization-Related Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01281956,TERMINATED,"Background:

- The brain chemical serotonin helps nerve cells communicate. Previous research suggests that serotonin activity may be lower in brain areas where seizures start, and that increasing activity at the serotonin receptor site on nerve cells may help prevent seizures. Researchers are interested in determining whether the experimental medication PRX-00023, which increases the activity of serotonin receptors, can reduce seizure frequency in people whose seizures are not well-controlled on antiseizure medication. PRX-00023 has not previously been studied in people with epilepsy and has not previously been given to people taking antiseizure medication at the same time.

Objectives:

- To evaluate the effectiveness of PRX-00023 in reducing the frequency of epileptic seizures that start from only one part of the brain.

Eligibility:

- Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have frequent epileptic seizures even after trying at least two different standard anti-seizure medications (either at the same time or one after the other).

Design:

* The study requires 9 outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center over a 34-week period. Individuals who choose to participate in additional studies may be an inpatient during some of these visits.
* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine samples, ECG, EEG, neuropsychological studies, imaging studies, including PET and MRI scans
* Participants will have a 6-week observation and evaluation period before starting the study medication. Participants who have at least four seizures during this period will be eligible for the treatment portion of the study.
* All participants will receive either PRX-00023 or a placebo pill twice daily for 12 weeks, and will have regular clinic visits with blood samples and imaging studies.
* After the 12-week period, participants will have a 2- to 3-week washout period without any study medication.
* Participants will then have another study medication period, and will receive the opposite pill (PRX-00023 or placebo) from the one taken in the first treatment phase. Participants will continue to have regular clinic visits with blood samples, ECG, EEG and neuropsychologicalstudies.
* One month after the end of the second study medication phase, participants will have a followup evaluation with a physical examination, blood tests, ECG, EEG, mood and neuropsychological tests.

Outcome measures:

The primary outcome measure for drug efficacy will be:

Mean difference in seizure frequency comparing the active and placebo periods.

NCT01463033,Levetiracetam to Prevent Post-Traumatic Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01463033,COMPLETED,"Head injury is the cause of approximately 5% of all epilepsy in the US. Past attempts at preventing epilepsy by treatment with older antiepileptic drugs have been unsuccessful. Levetiracetam is a novel AED with potent antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epilepsy. It has a favorable side effect and pharmacokinetic profile. It is therefore a strong candidate for a clinical trial of epilepsy prevention following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, there has been no experience in administering levetiracetam rapidly to individuals with acute TBI. The investigators propose to initiate the evaluation of levetiracetam in prevention of post-traumatic epilepsy by determining the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and feasibility of acute and chronic administration of levetiracetam to individuals with head injury with a high risk for developing post-traumatic epilepsy. Further, the investigators will follow subjects for 2 years after injury in order to obtain pilot data about effect of levetiracetam on PTE.

NCT01316445,Pharmacodynamics of Nasal and Buccal Midazolam Using EEG,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01316445,TERMINATED,"Approximately 3 million individuals suffer from epilepsy in America alone and about 200,000 new cases of epilepsy in America are diagnosed each year (Epilepsy Foundation, 2005). Epilepsy can be defined as a condition in which a person has recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Prolonged or back-to-back repetitive seizures, known as ""acute repetitive seizures"" (ARS), are medical emergencies. ARS can occur unexpectedly, a circumstance for which quick and efficient antiepileptic drugs are needed for household and prehospital use. Currently, benzodiazepines are the antiepileptic drug of choice when dealing with ARS because they are proven to be efficient and take little time to work. Benzodiazepines can be administered by mouth, by vein via a needle (intravenously; IV), rectally, between the cheek and gum (buccally), or in the nose (intranasally; IN). The nasal formulation is not yet FDA-approved. The rectal treatment route has been commonly used for acute seizure treatment in past years, but recent studies propose that the nasal route for benzodiazepines may be better overall for home treatment and easier to administer (see Wermeling, 2009). For many ""out of hospital"" situations, nasal benzodiazepines can be more convenient and more comfortable than rectal treatment. In addition to the above benefits, nasal benzodiazepines are rapidly absorbed by the blood vessels in the nose and the time of drug administration and cessation of seizures may thus be reduced using nasal routes. This study sets out to characterize how fast buccal and nasal treatments begin to work on the brain by monitoring brain waves during administration of the drug, and to determine whether nasal or buccal administration is best.",Epilepsy,DRUG: nasal Midazolam,"25% increase in total beta power for at least 1 minute at 10-30Hz, Quantitative and qualitative visual EEG analysis for benzodiazepine-induced beta activity, total power of \~10-30 Hz activity, for 30 mins after administration of drug",Columbia University,Upsher-Smith Laboratories,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,9,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2011-07,2014-02,"Columbia University Medical Center, Milstein Hospital, New York, New York, 10032, United States"

Given this significant burden, effective treatments to prevent dementia and new disease modifying therapies are urgently needed.

Regeneration of lost neurons with new ones (i.e., neurogenesis) is compromised at early stages of dementia and in part correlates with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Boosting the neurogenesis delays the cognitive impairment in animal models of dementia and has been proven beneficial in improving the memory in rodent studies.

NCT00085683,Herpes Virus-6 and Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00085683,COMPLETED,"This study will explore whether the human herpes virus-6 is associated with epileptic seizures. The virus may be involved in brain scarring, called mesial temporal sclerosis, which is seen in some epilepsy patients. The virus is also thought possibly to interfere with neurotransmitters - chemicals that brain cells use to communicate with each other. This study will measure levels of two of these chemicals, GABA and glutamate, which are believed to play a role in the development of seizures.

Patients with epilepsy, with or without mesial temporal sclerosis, and healthy control subjects 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Control subjects may not be taking any medication on a regular basis. Epilepsy patients may take only phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, or levetiracetam. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and blood tests.

Participants have blood drawn and undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture (spinal tap).

Blood Draw

Up to four teaspoons of blood are drawn through a needle in the arm for this study.

MRI

MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce pictures of the brain. The scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the scan, the subject lies on a bed that slides into the cylinder, wearing earplugs to muffle loud noises the machine makes when the magnetic fields are switched. The scan takes about 90 to 120 minutes, during which time the subject can communicate with the technician.

Lumbar Puncture

For this test the subject sits upright or lies on his or her side with knees curled at the chest. A local anesthetic is injected at the lower back, and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones where the cerebrospinal fluid circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the needle.

NCT01663545,Brain P-gp and Inflammation in People With Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01663545,COMPLETED,"Background:

* The brain is protected by a barrier that keeps toxins in the blood from reaching the brain. However, this barrier can also keep useful medications from reaching the brain. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a brain protein that is part of the blood-brain barrier. The level of P-gp is higher in people with epilepsy than in people without epilepsy. These different levels of P-gp may explain why some people have seizures that do not respond well to medications. Researchers want to see if P-gp can affect the response to epilepsy medications.
* Epilepsy may also be associated with brain inflammation. Researchers also want to look at the part of the brain affected by epilepsy to see if inflammation is present.

Objectives:

* To see if P-gp can affect the response to epilepsy medications.
* To see if inflammation is present in the part of the brain affected by epilepsy.

Eligibility:

* \<TAB\>Individuals between 18 and 60 years of age who have temporal lobe epilepsy. We plan to study some patients whose seizures are well controlled by drugs, and some whose seizures are not controlled.
* \<TAB\>
* Healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.

Design:

* This study requires four or five visits to the NIH Clinical Center over the course of a year. The visits will be outpatient visits and will last from 2 to 5 hours.
* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.
* All participants will have two positron emission tomography (PET) scans. The scans will take place during different visits. Different drugs will be used in each scan. One drug will be used to temporarily block the effect of P-gp in the brain. The other drug will show areas of inflammation in the brain.
* Participants with epilepsy will have a third PET scan. This scan will also look at P-gp activity in the brain. However, it will not use the drug that blocks the effect of P-gp.
* All participants will also have one magnetic resonance imaging scan. This scan will help show brain function.","Epilepsies, Partial",,"Amount of differential [11C]dLop and [11C]PBR28 uptake between the epileptic focus and the homologous contralateral region, study completion",National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,ADULT,,38,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,7/31/2012,,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States"

The reported benefit of this oil is to have the anticonvulsant properties of CBD without the psychoactive components of THC. Human studies on the efficacy of CBD on epilepsy are few and limited.

The investigators' specific aims are the following:

* Specific Aim 1: Describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of Cannabidiol (CBD), Tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), and their respective metabolites in pediatric patients with epilepsy.
* Specific Aim 2: Describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) taken in conjunction with CBD in order to evaluate drug interactions.
* Specific Aim 3: Describe parental perception of efficacy of CBD on control of epilepsy.

The investigators will recruit children and their parents who are currently using or plan to use CBD for their seizure disorder. This study will NOT be providing patients with CBD. Consenting subjects will undergo a number of blood and urine collection that will be analyzed to describe the pharmacokinetics and possible drug interactions of CBD in pediatric epilepsy.",Epilepsy,,"Describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of Cannabidiol (CBD), other antiepileptic drugs, Tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), and their respective metabolites in pediatric patients with epilepsy., Blood samples will be obtained at 6 time periods: at baseline prior to the first dose of CBD and at the following time intervals after administration of CBD: 1 hour, 2 hour, 4 hour, 8 hour, and 12 hours after administration of CBD.

Though unproven, these problems are often blamed on anti-seizure medications. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of the anti-seizure medication Lacosamide (Vimpat®) on sleep and wakefulness in adults with focal (partial onset) seizures.

Focal epilepsy, also called partial epilepsy, is a disorder characterized by seizures arising from a localized network of neurons in the brain. Focal seizures usually begin a sensation or involuntary movement of a part of the body, an unusual feeling, or a disturbance in hearing, smell, vision, or consciousness. The study is open to adults 18 and older with focal seizures.

Participation involves a physical exam, sleep testing at the Sleep Center, blood tests, completion of study questionnaires/diaries, and a random assignment to either take the study drug or placebo (often called a ""look alike"" or ""sugar pill"") for 5 to 8 weeks. There are 5 study visits. Participants will receive compensation for time spent in the study.

It will look at the contribution of those methods in determining the location of the epilepsy seizure, compared with doing so through an invasive method. EEG measures electronic potential differences on the scalp. On the other hand, MEG is a non-invasive technique for recording the activity of neurons in the brain, through recording of magnetic fields caused by synchronized neural currents. It has the ability to detect seizures. Because magnetic signals of the brain vary, this technique must balance two key problems: weakness of the signal and strength of the noise. The EEG is sensitive to extra-cellular volume currents, whereas the MEG primarily registers intra-cellular currents. Because electrical fields are quite dependent on the conductive properties of the tissues, and magnetic fields are significantly less distorted by tissue, the MEG has better spatial resolution. There is a great deal of evidence that EEG and MEG provide complementary data about underlying currents of ions.

Patients 18 years of age or older who have epilepsy that is not relieved, and who are considered candidates for surgery and who accept epilepsy surgery, may be eligible for this study.

Before they have surgery, participants will either sit or lie down, with their head in a helmet covering the entire head, with openings for the eyes and ears.

Its primary goal is to minimize surgical risk probability (i.e., functional deficit) and maximize surgical benefit probability (i.e., seizure freedom) by precisely localizing eloquent white matter pathways in children and adolescents with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. This new imaging approach, which will acquire a DWMRI scan before pediatric epilepsy surgery in about 10 minutes without contrast administration (and also without sedation even in young children), can be readily applied to improve preoperative benefit-risk evaluation for pediatric epilepsy surgery in the future. The investigators will also study how the advanced DWMRI-DCNN connectome approach can detect complex signs of brain neuronal reorganization that help improve neurological and cognitive outcomes following pediatric epilepsy surgery. This new imaging approach could benefit targeted interventions in the future to minimize neurocognitive deficits in affected children.

NCT05406349,Neural Mechanisms of Spatial Representations Beyond the Self,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05406349,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Spatial navigation is a fundamental human behavior, and deficits in navigational functions are among the hallmark symptoms of severe neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Understanding how the human brain processes and encodes spatial information is thus of critical importance for the development of therapies for affected patients. Previous studies have shown that the brain forms neural representations of spatial information, via spatially-tuned activity of single neurons (e.g., place cells, grid cells, or head direction cells), and by the coordinated oscillatory activity of cell populations. The vast majority of these studies have focused on the encoding of self-related spatial information, such as one's own location, orientation, and movements. However, everyday tasks in social settings require the encoding of spatial information not only for oneself, but also for other people in the environment. At present, it is largely unknown how the human brain accomplishes this important function, and how aspects of human cognition may affect these spatial encoding mechanisms. This project therefore aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms that underlie the encoding of spatial information and awareness of others. Specifically, the proposed research plan will determine how human deep brain oscillations and single-neuron activity allow us to keep track of other individuals as they move through our environment. Next, the project will determine whether these spatial encoding mechanisms are specific to the encoding of another person, or whether they can be used more flexibly to support the encoding of moving inanimate objects and even more abstract cognitive functions such as imagined navigation. Finally, the project will determine how spatial information is encoded in more complex real-world scenarios, when multiple information sources (e.g., multiple people) are present. To address these questions, intracranial medial temporal lobe activity will be recorded from two rare participant groups: (1) Participants with permanently implanted depth electrodes for the treatment of focal epilepsy through responsive neurostimulation (RNS), who provide a unique opportunity to record deep brain oscillations during free movement and naturalistic behavior; and (2) hospitalized epilepsy patients with temporarily implanted intracranial electrodes in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), from whom joint oscillatory and single-neuron activity can be recorded.",Epilepsy Intractable,BEHAVIORAL: Self-navigation task|BEHAVIORAL: Observation task,"Oscillatory power, It will be measured how the oscillatory power (measurement unit: microvolts-squared) of electrophysiological brain activity, as measured via intracranially implanted electrodes and an electroencephalography recording system, is modulated by task-related behavioral variables (such as the individual's spatial location, head direction, movement speed, or their distance/direction to environmental boundaries)., Continuous measurement during task performance on day 1 and all subsequent measurement days (up to 14 days per participant)|Oscillatory amplitude, It will be measured how the oscillatory amplitude (measurement unit: microvolts) of electrophysiological brain activity, as measured via intracranially implanted electrodes and an electroencephalography recording system, is modulated by task-related behavioral variables (such as the individual's spatial location, head direction, movement speed, or their distance/direction to environmental boundaries)., Continuous measurement during task performance on day 1 and all subsequent measurement days (up to 14 days per participant)|Oscillatory frequency, It will be measured how the frequency of an oscillation (measurement unit: Hertz), as measured via intracranially implanted electrodes and an electroencephalography recording system, is modulated by task-related behavioral variables (such as the individual's spatial location, head direction, movement speed, or their distance/direction to environmental boundaries)., Continuous measurement during task performance on day 1 and all subsequent measurement days (up to 14 days per participant)|Firing rate of single neurons, It will be measured how the firing rate of single neurons (measurement unit: Hertz), as measured via intracranially implanted micro-electrodes and an electrophysiology recording system, is modulated by task-related behavioral variables (such as the individual's spatial location, head direction, movement speed, or their distance/direction to environmental boundaries)., Continuous measurement during task performance on day 1 and all subsequent measurement days (up to 14 days per participant)","University of California, Los Angeles",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,14,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,8/6/2022,2027-04,"University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States"

NCT00344877,Electrical Brain Stimulation to Reduce Epileptic Seizures,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00344877,COMPLETED,"OBJECTIVES:

About 15% of patients suffering from focal epilepsy are refractory to available pharmacological treatments. Until now, the only hope for such patients has been the development of new pharmaceutical treatments or epilepsy surgery. In case of inoperability, different types of invasive brain stimulation such as vagus nerve stimulation or deep brain stimulation or non-invasive repetitive TMS have been evaluated to determine their anticonvulsive potential. For rTMS, weak and short lasting seizure reduction has been reported in different epilepsy syndromes.

A new, non-invasive stimulation technique, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), was useful to modulate cortical excitability in many cortical areas (M1, visual cortex, frontal cortex). Cathodal tDCS, with a current of 1 mA, induced long-term depression in animal models and reportedly decreased the excitability of both human and animal cerebral cortex. In epilepsy patients suffering from a malformation of cortical development, a single session of cathodal tDCS helped reduce seizures briefly. The purpose of this protocol is to study the effects of repeated applications of tDCS on the excitability of the seizure focus in patients with poorly controlled pharmacologically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy.

STUDY POPULATION:

We plan to study 56 patients between the ages of 18 and 80 suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy.

DESIGN:

Subjects will be allocated by blocked randomization to one of two groups (parallel design). Group A will receive cathodal tDCS and group B will receive Sham-tDCS on five consecutive days. Each subject will participate in 9 sessions (1 baseline visit, 5 intervention visits, 3 follow-up visits). The effect of the intervention relative to the sham stimulation will be evaluated by comparing seizure frequency and neuropsychological tests during the 8 weeks before and after the intervention.

OUTCOME MEASURES:

Primary outcome measure will be the mean seizure frequency per 4 weeks in the tDCS group as compared to the Sham-tDCS group. To analyze the effect of the intervention (tDCS), seizures will be evaluated during a 2x4 week baseline period before tDCS and 2x4 weeks after the intervention. Using these data we will calculate the percentage change of seizures per 4 weeks.

Secondary outcome measures will be the scores of the neuropsychological testing (HVLT-R, BVMT-R, CTMT, COWAT) and number of epileptiform discharges in the EEG.

NCT01713777,Equivalence Among Antiepileptic Drug Generic and Brand Products in People With Epilepsy: Chronic-Dose 4-Period Replicate Design,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01713777,COMPLETED,"The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specific rules generic drug companies must follow to get a generic copy of a seizure medication approved. Currently, the FDA approves generic drugs by requiring studies on normal volunteers who don't have epilepsy and who take just one dose of the generic drug followed by a series of blood tests. Some people with epilepsy and their physicians have complained about side effects or loss of seizure control when taking generic drugs, but no one knows if these complaints are truly because of problems with the generic drugs.

When the FDA tests generic copies of lamotrigine (LTG), the blood levels measured after volunteers receive the generic lamotrigine tablets are allowed to fall within a specific range. This research will test whether two different manufacturer's generic lamotrigine, that fall in different parts of that range, perform in a similar way when given to people with epilepsy every day over a several week period. The two products will be called GENERIC A and GENERIC B.

NCT00884351,Magnetoencephalography in Absence Seizures,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00884351,COMPLETED,"Background:

* An absence seizure is a type of seizure that usually begins in childhood and goes away by early adulthood. Scientists do not yet know where absence seizures begin in the brain. Some evidence suggests that these seizures begin in the thalamus, a structure deep in the brain, but other studies suggest that they begin in the frontal cortex, at the front part of the brain.
* Magnetoencephalography is a type of brain scanning procedure that is useful in determining information about what happens to the brain during epileptic seizures. Understanding where absence seizures come from may help doctors find new treatments for them.

Objectives:

* To gain a better understanding of which parts of the brain are affected in absence seizures.

Eligibility:

* Patients 7 to 35 years of age who have been diagnosed with absence seizures.

Design:

* Procedures are for research purposes only, not to diagnose or treat a particular medical condition.
* Two outpatient visits to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center: evaluation and scanning.
* Researchers will evaluate potential participants with a medical history, physical examination, and electroencephalography (EEG). These tests will be performed under another protocol, 01-N-0139.
* Patients will undergo magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The study procedures will be performed one time; however, an MEG or MRI scan may need to be repeated for technical reasons. Researchers will not do more than two MEG or MRI scans.
* The MEG will record very small magnetic field changes produced by the activity of the brain. An EEG will be recorded at the same time as the MEG.
* The MRI will use a magnetic field to take pictures of the inside of the brain.
* The MEG will take 3 hours to complete (2 hours for preparation, 1 hour in the scanner). The MRI will take approximately 1 hour.",Seizures,,,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",,5,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,4/15/2009,,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States"

NCT00610532,Evaluating the Transporter Protein Inhibitor Probenecid In Patients With Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00610532,TERMINATED,"The study is being done to understand why some patients with epilepsy (disease of recurrence of seizures) do not respond very well to drug treatment with anticonvulsants.

Despite the availability of many anticonvulsants, about 30% of patients with epilepsy are resistant to them. The cause of the resistance is not clear, but one of the reasons could be an increased amount of proteins in the cells of the body called transporter proteins.

Transporter proteins are a group of proteins that help to defend the body against toxins, including drugs, by pumping them out of the cells. Studies have shown that the number of transporter proteins is higher in the parts of the brain that trigger seizures when compared to other parts of the brain.

Studies in animals have shown that taking an anticonvulsant with an inhibitor (meaning ""to stop"" or ""to reduce"") of a transporter protein can increase the concentration of that anticonvulsant inside the brain cells. The main purpose of the study is to determine if taking an anticonvulsant and a transporter protein inhibitor will change the brain concentration of the anticonvulsant.

In this study, a single dose of phenytoin (Dilantin® is a brand name anticonvulsant which has phenytoin as its active ingredient), a commonly used anticonvulsant, will be given once by itself, and then will be given a separate time with a single (i.e. one time only) dose of probenecid. Probenecid, a medicine used commonly to treat gout (a disease of increased uric acid), is known to be an inhibitor of transporter proteins. The study will use electroencephalogram or EEG (recording of brain wave activities) to determine if the EEG pattern when probenecid is given, will be different from the EEG pattern when phenytoin is given alone. This will suggest that probenecid has affected the brain concentration of phenytoin.",Epilepsy,DRUG: phenytoin|DRUG: phenytoin and probenecid,"Quantitative EEG Recordings, end of each treatment",Jim McAuley,,MALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,8,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2006-03,2011-06,"The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, United States"

Together, this knowledge will advance ANT deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy by providing a physiologic basis for patient selection for ANT DBS, while identifying brain signals and stimulation patterns that can be used to develop novel methods for ANT DBS. Up to 15 adult patients (18 and older) who present to Duke Neurosurgery for routine seizure localization using sEEG will be asked to enroll in this pilot study of ANT recording and stimulation. In the course of surgical epilepsy treatment, patients routinely undergo surgical placement of sEEG electrodes for the purposes of seizure localization. During this procedure, 2 additional leads will be placed in the ANT. These patients remain hospitalized for 7-14 days after sEEG placement, during which time their seizure medications are tapered. Concurrent video monitoring is performed while continuous neural recordings are made through the sEEG electrodes. Additionally, continuous recordings will be performed through the electrodes placed in the thalamus. Periodically, standard intermittent high-frequency stimulation (130 Hz, 90-ms pulse width, and 2 mA intensity) will be performed with a 60-s on and a 300-s off cycle after surgery. These standard ANT stimulation parameters are employed clinically.

Glut 1 is a protein that helps transport glucose to the brain. Glucose is the brain's primary source of energy. Glut 1 DS prevents this protein from being effectively produced, causing deprivation of energy to the neurons of the of the brain.

Glut1 DS is a severely debilitating disease characterized by seizures, developmental delay and movement disorder. There are currently no approved treatments specific to Glut1 DS. Treatment generally includes medications for control of seizures. The use of a ketogenic diet can be effective in controlling seizures when medications are ineffective or provide insufficient control. However, the ketogenic diet may be very difficult for patients to maintain for long periods of time, and there may be negative secondary long-term effects of ketogenic diet.. Triheptanoin is metabolized to molecules that can provide an alternative energy source to the brain, and appears to help in controlling seizures without many of the difficulties of the ketogenic diet.

NCT03318237,Ultra High Field MRI of Focal Pediatric Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03318237,TERMINATED,"Epilepsy affects a significant number of children in the United States. The majority of patients achieve control of their seizures by conventional treatment strategies including medications. However, one third of patients do not achieve satisfactory seizure control with medications alone. Ketogenic diet and lifestyle modifications may also be tried. In some of these children, the seizure focus can be localized to one area of the brain and the seizures are resistant to conservative treatment strategies. These children may have subtle structural/developmental abnormalities in their brain, the most frequent of which is focal cortical dysplasia. These are localized areas of abnormal lamination of the cerebral cortex that can be extremely subtle and difficult to detect, even with state of the art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). More importantly, these lesions may be amenable to surgical resection resulting in marked decrease in frequency or even resolution of seizures.

MRI is a noninvasive imaging modality without ionizing radiation that has played a central role in the assessment of anatomy, physiology/pathophysiology of children with epilepsy. It is particularly useful in children with refractory focal epilepsy. Prior studies have shown that high resolution, high-field (3T) MR imaging of the brain helps to identify subtle focal epileptogenic abnormalities, including focal cortical dysplasia, in some patients. However, there is scarce data directly comparing the performance of ultra high-field (7T) MRI, currently an investigative technique offering optimized contrast and signal-to-noise rations and superior spatial resolution, with clinically available 3T MR imaging.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether ultra high-field (7T) MR imaging improves detection and characterization of subtle structural epileptogenic abnormalities in children with focal epilepsy.

The importance of this research is that identification of a focal epileptogenic lesion in children with refractory epilepsy has fundamental management implications, as surgical removal of such lesion may dramatically improve outcomes and the chance of seizure freedom.",Epilepsy,,"Detection rate of subtle structural epileptogenic abnormalities in children with focal epilepsy., The rate of abnormal findings detected by 7T MRI in children with focal epilepsy will be recorded, as well as their location and relationship with abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) findings.

NCT01608178,Taurine Therapy for SSADH Deficiency,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01608178,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is a rare genetic disease that results in changes to certain brain chemicals. These chemicals may affect brain excitability, or how likely nerve cells are to turn on. Changes in brain excitability may help to explain the symptoms of the disease, including learning and memory problems, seizures, and poor balance. A supplement called taurine may help people with SSADH deficiency by working on the brain chemical GABA. GABA helps to regulate brain activity. Researchers want to see if taurine can help people with SSADH deficiency.

Objectives:

- To learn more about how taurine affects the brain in people with SSADH deficiency.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 12 years of age who have SSADH deficiency.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will provide blood and urine samples. They will also take taurine supplements as part of this protocol.
* Participants will have two sets of study tests. One set will be given while participants are taking taurine. The second will be given when they are not taking it. Each testing session will take about 2 days to complete.
* Half of the participants will have the ""off taurine"" testing before starting on the taurine supplement. The other half will start taking taurine first, have the ""on taurine"" testing, and have the ""off taurine"" testing about 3 months after stopping taurine. Participants may decide the order in which they will have the testing done.
* Participants will have the following tests at the two test visits:
* Paper and pencil tests of learning and memory.
* Transcranial magnetic stimulation to study the excitability of nerve cells.

Seizure reduction and improvements in the quality of life in patients with epilepsy will be associated with increased cortical inhibition resulting from the LF-rTMS sessions over time. This procedure using rTMS at low frequencies (LF-rTMS) between 0.5 and 1 Hz is a safe and painless method for noninvasive focal cortical brain stimulation, which will be evaluated in its efficacy at reducing/suppressing seizures. Accordingly, we propose a clinical trial in patients with epilepsy to test whether LF-rTMS can improve seizure suppression. The location of the presumed 3D source in the brain will be stimulated for few minutes (10 to 15 min.). With the same rTMS modality, we will also perform motor threshold mapping in conjunction with its fully integrated and compatible electroencephalography (EEG) module.

The identification of biomarkers that predict the likelihood of disease response would allow epilepsy patients to make more informed decisions about the factors affecting their quality of life, including plans for driving, relationships, pregnancy, schooling, work, and play. In addition to its impact on clinical care, the data and specimens collected in HEP3, including sequential electrophysiology, biochemical profiles and neuroimaging and banked DNA for future genomics studies, have the potential to provide new insights into the biological basis of IGE, thereby advancing the discovery of effective treatments and cures.

NCT00001288,Brain Blood Flow Studies of Language and Memory,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00001288,COMPLETED,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique used to investigate the functional activity of the brain. The PET technique allows doctors to study the normal processes of the brain (central nervous system) of normal individuals and patients with neurologic illnesses without physical / structural damage to the brain.

When a region of the brain is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar (glucose). As the brain uses more fuel it produces more waste products, carbon dioxide and water. Blood carries fuel to the brain and waste products away from the brain. As brain activity increases blood flow to and from the area of activity increases also. Knowing these facts, researchers can use radioactive water (H215O) and PET scans to observe what areas of the brain are receiving more blood flow.

This study is designed to use positron emission tomography (PET) with radioactive water (H215O) to determine the areas of the brain associated with memory and language.

Healthy volunteers and people with seizures uncontrolled by anti-epileptic drugs who are between 18 and 45 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and laboratory tests.

Participants undergo the following procedures:

* PET scan. This test uses a radioactive chemical called 18FDG, which is detected by the PET scanner to obtain images of the brain. The subject lies on a table with his or her head positioned in the scanner. A swimming cap with a small light reflector is placed on the head to monitor the position of the head during the scan. A catheter (plastic tube) is inserted into an artery at the wrist or elbow crease of the arm for obtaining blood samples during the scan, and a second catheter is placed in a vein in the other arm for injecting the 18FDG. The scan takes up to 2 hours. A second scan may be done over an additional 15 minutes.
* MRI. This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain. The subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. Most scans last between 45 and 90 minutes.
* Lumbar puncture. The subject sits upright or lies on a table with the knees curled to the chest for this procedure. A local anesthetic is injected to numb the skin and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord.

NCT05283811,Understanding Prefrontal and Medial Temporal Neuronal Responses to Algorithmic Cognitive Variables in Epilepsy Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05283811,RECRUITING,"Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is human's ability to respond correctly to novel contextual situations on the first attempt, without prior rehearsal. The investigators refer to this ability as 'ad hoc self-programming': 'ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; 'self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. The overall goal of our research effort is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior. The previous U01 project (NS 108923) focused on how these programs of action are initially created. The results thus far have revealed tantalizing notions of how the brain represents these programs and navigates through the programs. In this proposal, therefore, the investigators focus on the question of how these mental programs are executed. Based on the preliminary findings and critical conceptual work, the investigators propose that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) creates representations of the critical elements of these mental programs, including concepts such as 'rules' and 'locations', to allow for effective navigation through the algorithm. These data suggest the existence of an 'algorithmic state space' represented in medial temporal and prefrontal regions. This proposal aims to understand the neurophysiological underpinnings of this algorithmic state space in humans. By studying humans, the investigators will profit from our species' powerful capacity for generalization to understand how such state spaces are constructed. The investigators therefore leverage the unique opportunities available in human neuroscience research to record from single cells and population-level signals, as well as to use intracranial stimulation for causal testing, to address this challenging problem. In Aim 1 the investigators study the basic representations of algorithmic state space using a novel behavioral task that requires the immediate formation of unique plans of action. Aim 2 directly compares representations of algorithmic state space to that of physical space by juxtaposing balanced versions of spatial and algorithmic tasks in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Finally, in Aim 3, the investigators test hypotheses regarding interactions between vPFC and MTL using intracranial stimulation.",Epilepsy,DEVICE: NEUROPACE RNS SYSTEM|BEHAVIORAL: EMU,"Behavioral performance (Accuracy as fraction of correct responses), Patients will be asked to perform a few different novel, computerized tasks where the patients must respond to on-screen stimuli using button presses.

NCT00581893,"Phenytoin and Driving Safety: A Randomized, Controlled Cross-Over Study",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00581893,COMPLETED,"Automobile driving is a crucial aspect of everyday life, yet vehicular crashes represent a serious public health problem. Patients with epilepsy are at elevated risk for automobile crashes, causing great personal suffering and financial costs to society. Most collisions involving epileptic drivers are not seizure related but may instead result from cognitive effects upon driving performance of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Several million American drivers take AEDs for treatment of medical conditions besides epilepsy and may also be at risk for cognitive impairments that can reduce driving performance. Empirical evidence of the effects of AEDs on driving performance would enable development of driving guidelines that could lower the risk of injurious motor vehicle collisions; however, this evidence is currently lacking. The broad goal of our project is to determine the specific effects of the most commonly utilized AED, phenytoin, by assessing driving performance and cognitive abilities in neurologically normal volunteers taking phenytoin in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Our proposed experiments will assess: (1) cognitive functions using standardized neuropsychological tests (of attention, perception, memory, and executive functions), (2) driving performance during phenytoin and placebo administration, and (3) the effects of phenytoin-related cognitive performance upon driving performance. To measure driving performance, we will use a state-of-the-art fixed-base interactive driving simulator that allows us to observe driver errors in an environment that is challenging yet safe for the driver and tester, under conditions of optimal stimulus and response control. The results of this study of 30 drivers treated with phenytoin and placebo will increase the understanding of the role of AED-related cognitive impairment on driving safety errors. A better understanding of the impact of AEDs upon driving performance is necessary to rationally develop interventions that could help prevent crashes by drivers treated with AEDs.",Cognitive Measures|Driving Simulator Performance,DRUG: Phenytoin|DRUG: Placebo oral capsule,"Number of Subjects Who Had a Driving Simulator Crash Event, Number of subjects who had a crash event during the driving simulator test., 1 month",University of Iowa,,ALL,ADULT,PHASE4,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: OTHER",2005-08,2008-12,"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, 52242, United States"

All participants will have a physical examination at the beginning of the study, at each clinic visit, and at completion or withdrawal from the study. In addition, they will undergo the following procedures:

Baseline Monitoring

For the first 2 months, all participants will keep a diary of their temperature and onset of menses. Women with epilepsy will also record their seizures.

Electroencephalography (EEG)

Healthy volunteers will have a 45-minute EEG (recording of the electrical activity of the brain) at the beginning of each menstrual cycle and each day during the menses. Women with epilepsy will have continuous EEG monitoring for 8 days, beginning 5 days before their menstrual period is expected. The continuous monitoring can be done on an outpatient basis, using a portable EEG recording device, or as an inpatient, with admission to the hospital for the 8 days of recording.

NCT01299870,Catamenial Epilepsy Treatment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01299870,UNKNOWN,"Epilepsy is a disorder in the brain. The brain is full of ""nerve"" cells. Nerve cells have normal electrical activity to control the many functions of the body. Sometimes nerve cells do not function normally due to many different reasons such as disease, an injury or because the brain didn't develop normally at birth. When nerve cells do not function normally the electrical activity that controls things like muscles and body movement can get mixed up and cause seizures. When a seizure occurs, sometimes a person loses control of body movement, and/or bodily functions. When a seizure occurs, a person may become unconscious, and/or senses may be affected. Seizures can occur at any time, without warning, and can lead to many health problems.

""Catamenial epilepsy"" is specific form of epilepsy in women. It is closely related to the menstrual cycle. In this form of epilepsy seizures increase around the menstrual period.

MRI is a diagnostic and research tool that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. During the test, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder. DTI involves taking pictures of the brain while the subject is at rest in order to learn about the structure of the brain. Information gained from this study will help scientists evaluate the organization of language and emotional functions in the brain.

Studies in animals have shown that serotonin-a chemical messenger produced by the body-attaches to proteins on brain cells called 5HT1A receptors and changes them in some way that may help control seizures. There is little information on these changes, however. A new compound that is highly sensitive to 5HT1A, will be used in PET imaging to measure the level of activity of these receptors and try to detect abnormalities. Changes in receptor activity may help determine where in the brain the seizures are originating.

Additional PET scans will be done to measure the amount of blood flow to the brain and the rate at which the brain uses glucose-a sugar that is the brain's main fuel. Blood flow measurement is used to calculate the distribution of serotonin receptors, and glucose use helps determine how seizures affect brain function.

NCT03790137,Treatment of Sunflower Syndrome With ZX008 (Fenfluramine Hydrochloride) in Children and Young Adults (Ages 4-25).,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03790137,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Sunflower Syndrome (also referred to as Self-induced Photosensitive Epilepsy) is a rare epileptic disorder characterized by a distinctive seizure that manifests itself in a highly stereotyped physical behavior. Seizure types associated with Sunflower Syndrome include absence seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Individuals with Sunflower Syndrome obsessively seek out a light source, stare at the light source, and wave one hand in front of their eye(s). Electroencephalogram (EEG) features include generalized spike and wave discharges interictally, and typically strong photoparoxysmal response during photic stimulation.

Currently, Sunflower syndrome is poorly characterized in medical literature and is often misunderstood at the clinical level. The name self-induced photosensitive epilepsy may be a misnomer as research concerning the neurochemical and neuropsychological pathways cannot conclusively determine that it is self-induced (conscious behavior) as the name implies. Although some reports have concluded that the hand waiving induces the seizure, these findings are not consistent throughout scientific literature. In fact, an EEG report found that the seizures can begin simultaneously with the hand waving. This suggests that the hand waving may in fact be part of the seizure, not the cause.

There are no treatments specifically approved for the treatment of Sunflower Syndrome in the United States. Broad spectrum anticonvulsant medications, including sodium valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and clobazam, have not shown full efficacy in seizure prevention in patients with Sunflower Syndrome. Accordingly, there remains a significant unmet need for an approved treatment for children and adults with Sunflower Syndrome.

Because this epilepsy typically does not respond to anticonvulsant medications, and because Aicardi described the successful treatment with fenfluramine of at least one child with this syndrome, the investigators of this study will investigate if fenfluramine is an effective, safe and well tolerated treatment for Sunflower Syndrome.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of ZX008 on seizure frequency in children and young adults with Sunflower Syndrome. The goal of treatment is to provide a 30 percent or greater reduction of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or hand waving associated with absence seizures.

Secondary objectives of the study include evaluation of the effect of ZX008 (fenfluramine hydrochloride) on EEG patterns and quality of life. Patients with Sunflower Syndrome often experience low self-esteem, bullying due to the unusual motor movements associated with their seizures, school performance issues, anxiety, and depression.

The study population will include pediatric and young adult patients seen by Elizabeth A. Thiele, M.D., Ph.D. at MGH's Pediatric Epilepsy Clinic who were identified as candidates. The Principal Investigator (PI) will follow up to 20 patients with Sunflower Syndrome who will be taking ZX008.",Photosensitive Epilepsy,DRUG: Fenfluramine Hydrochloride,"% Change in Frequency of Handwaving Episodes, The number of handwaving episodes (seizures) per day were recorded on a seizure diary by either the subject or the parent of the subject. One handwaving episode was defined as the period starting from when the hand first came up toward the face, until there was a brief pause in waving. Subjects and their caregivers were instructed to record the total number of handwaving episodes each day during a one month baseline, and during the 3 month treatment period.

The baseline seizure frequency was calculated as an average of the reported handwaving episodes per day during the baseline period. This number was compared to the average episodes per day for the final month of the study (month 3 of treatment with fenfluramine) for each patient. The median percent change in frequency of handwaving episodes across all patients is reported below., Month 3|Change in Frequency of Generalized Tonic-clonic Seizures, Daily seizure logs will be maintained by either the subject or the parent of the subject and used to calculate seizure frequency.

NCT02913742,The Utility of NIOM During LITT for Refractory MTLE,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02913742,WITHDRAWN,"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common cause of medication-resistant epilepsy in adults, and MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy is a new approach to its surgical management; however, while LITT demonstrates fewer complications than traditional surgical techniques, it generates lower rates of seizure freedom. During traditional temporal lobectomy for MTLE, neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring (NIOM) can be used to better identify epileptogenic tissue and guide resection. Our study proposes to investigate the utility of NIOM during LITT for MTLE. Subjects will be drawn from refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients determined to be candidates for LITT. During their LITT surgery, in addition to the placement of the stereotactic LITT probe, subjects will receive a second smaller stereotactic electrode for intraoperative monitoring of epileptic discharges before and after surgery. After surgery, at regularly scheduled follow-ups, patients will receive the Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire (QOLIE-31-P), in addition to standard post-operative care. Endpoints will be surgical complications, fractional decrement in epileptiform discharges from pre- to post-ablation recordings, and surgical outcome at 6 months and one year. Analysis of severe complications will be expressed as a simple complication rate, for overall complications, severe complications, and hemorrhagic complications in specific. The relationship between fractional discharge decrement and outcome will be assessed by regression analysis. Risks of the study will stem from the placement of the stereotactic electrode for intraoperative monitoring, which represents a small incremental risk beyond typical LITT for MTLE.","Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe",PROCEDURE: monitoring by depth electrode,"fractional decrement in interictal epileptiform discharges (ID) from pre- to post-ablation, Analysis of NIOM ID recordings will focus on fractional decrement of discharge counts from pre- to post-operative recordings.

NCT01054599,Does Memantine Improve Verbal Memory Task Performance in Subjects With Partial Epilepsy and Memory Dysfunction?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01054599,COMPLETED,"Many patients with epilepsy have memory deficits in the setting of otherwise normal intelligence. Unfortunately, the treatment options for memory dysfunction in patients with epilepsy are limited. The investigators are conducting a study to evaluate the effects of memantine for the treatment of verbal memory dysfunction in subjects with localization-related seizures. The study involves randomization to memantine therapy or placebo, with cognitive testing and EEG pre- and post-treatment, as well as after an open-label memantine treatment phase.

The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of memantine for the treatment of verbal memory dysfunction in subjects with left temporal lobe epilepsy. The investigators expect that verbal memory task performance will improve in those taking memantine, but not in those taking a placebo.

The investigators propose that the expected benefit of memantine is specific to verbal memory in subjects with left temporal lobe seizures, rather than representing an overall improvement in cognitive function. The investigators expect no improvement on other cognitive tasks in either the memantine or placebo groups.

The investigators will evaluate whether subjects with left temporal lobe epilepsy and memory difficulties have self-reported improvement in memory while taking memantine.

The time between stimulation and the return of voluntary muscle activity is the CSP, measured in milliseconds (ms)., 1 year|Ratio of motor evoked potential amplitudes (no units), Facilitation (ICF) are paired-pulse TMS metrics of cortical inhibition and excitability, respectively. A short interval interstimulus (1-5 ms) leads to cortical inhibition reflective of GABAergic neurotransmission; a longer interval interstimulus of 10-20 ms leads to a cortical facilitation, which reflects glutamatergic neurotransmission; an even longer interstimulus interval of 50-300 ms reflects GABAB-mediated local inhibition and likely GABAA-mediated network inhibition. The ratio of the peak-to-peak amplitude (in mm) of the second MEP to the first (or control) MEP will be calculated for each of these stimulation protocols., 1 year|Cortical Inhibitory Tone, Power in the gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency band., 1 year",Boston Children's Hospital,Encoded Therapeutics,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",,6,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,11/2/2020,2022-12,"Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States"

NCT01793532,Study of [11C]DPA-713 for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01793532,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Some people with epilepsy have an epileptic focus, a small part of the brain that is the starting point of the seizure. This focus is like an irritant or an inflammation, and helps cause the seizure. People with epilepsy that affects the temporal lobe of the brain often have an epileptic focus. Researchers want to look at the epileptic focus by using a drug that attaches to a protein associated with inflammation. An imaging study with the drug will show how much inflammation is in the area of the brain where the seizures start. The drug, called \[11C\]DPA-713, will be tested for its effectiveness in people with temporal lobe epilepsy. Its effects will be compared with imaging studies given to healthy volunteers.

Objectives:

- To see if \[11C\]DPA-713 can show the inflammation in the epileptic focus of seizures.

Eligibility:

* Individuals at least 18 years of age who have temporal lobe epilepsy.
* Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

Design:

* Participants will have three outpatient visits to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. The visits will last from 2 to 5 hours.
* Participants will be screened with a physical exam, neurological exam, and medical history. Blood samples will be collected before the start of the study.
* Participants will have a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This scan will be used to look at brain chemistry and function. The study drug will be given during the scan to see how well it shows points of inflammation in the brain. Some participants will provide additional blood samples during the PET scan.
* Participants will also have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This scan will look at the structure of the brain.",Epilepsy|Temporal Lobe,,"Brain uptake of radioligand, 90 minutes",National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,38,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,1/31/2013,6/8/2016,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States"

NCT00004637,"Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Vitamin E as Add-on Therapy for Children With Epilepsy",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00004637,COMPLETED,"This is a study to see if vitamin E helps children with epilepsy have fewer seizures. About 20-30% of children with epilepsy do not have adequate seizure control with established antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Other options for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy are newer antiepileptic medications, ketogenic diet and surgery. However, a small percentage of patients are candidates for these options. Therefore, additional treatments are needed to improve seizure control in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. Animal studies have shown an association between vitamin E supplementation and seizure reduction. A study in children also showed that vitamin E helped reduce seizures. However, a similar study in adults did not show a reduction in seizures with vitamin E supplementation. Therefore, this research study is being done to help define vitamin E's usefulness and safety as a treatment for epilepsy. Fifty patients will be recruited from the Children's Epilepsy Program at The Children's Hospital in Denver, Colorado. Qualifying patients will have a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy that is currently uncontrolled with standard AEDs. The study period is 6 months and includes the following: Baseline period (1 month), Arm I (2 months), Wash-out period (1 month), and Arm II (2 months). Patients must have been on the same AEDs for 2 months before enrollment. All medications and complementary therapies must remain constant throughout the study. If at any point the physician feels it is not best for the patient to continue the study they will be discontinued. Before the study starts, study participants will be asked about seizure activity, what they eat and about any complementary and/or alternative medicine they may use. The study is two phases. Study participants will be given either vitamin E or placebo (fake pill/liquid) in each phase of the study. They will receive both vitamin E and placebo during the study. Which phase they receive vitamin E and placebo will be decided by chance (similar to rolling dice). Study participants will take liquid vitamin E or placebo two times per day. The study participants and study doctors will not know who is taking vitamin E and who is taking placebo. Study participants will come to the hospital for 3 outpatient and 2 inpatient visits.

NCT02241798,Pre-oxygenation and Measures of Gas Exchanges During Seizures in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02241798,TERMINATED,"The primary goal of the study is to assess the effect of pre-oxygenation on oxygen and carbon dioxide levels during seizures in patients admitted at the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU). The investigators hypothesize that providing oxygen prior to seizures will help eliminate the drops in changes seen during seizures, such as the drop in oxygen saturation and increase in carbon dioxide levels.

Research will be done on patients that are admitted to the EMU specifically to have seizures occur and to be recorded on video electroencephalography (vEEG), and the only research intervention will be the use of oxygen prior to some of the seizures.

The importance of this research relates to the phenomenon of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP). SUDEP cases are typically patients with epilepsy who are found dead by their families in the morning, without a clear cause for death. The risk of SUDEP is as high as 9.3 per 1000 person-years (Shorvon and Tomson 2011). There may be multiple mechanisms for SUDEP to occur, however a leading hypothesis is a decrease in ventilation during the seizure leading to hypoxia. Blood oxygen saturation levels have been found to decrease significantly in 25-50% of patients during or shortly after a seizure while being monitored in hospitals. In rare situations, a significantly lowered oxygen level may trigger a cascade of events from which the body may not be able to recover, leading to SUDEP. In animal models, providing oxygen prior to seizures occurring has been shown to eliminate oxygen desaturation, but more importantly eliminate mortality in animals prone to death due to seizures.

Pre-oxygenation is a standard procedure during rapid-sequence induction anesthesia as it reduces the risk of oxygen desaturation during the apneic period of the procedure. On room air, the estimated duration of safe apnea is 1 minute, but this can increase to 8 minutes following pre-treatment with high FiO2 (Weingart and Levitan 2012). This is primarily due to oxygen replacing nitrogen within alveoli, creating a reservoir of oxygen within the lungs from which transfer to the bloodstream can continue despite the lack of ventilation. The apneic episode during seizures should benefit from the same principle.

The main purpose of the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) is to evaluate patients to better characterize seizures, to identify the main seizure focus. In addition to standard EEG with electrodes on the scalp, some patients require invasive localization of the epileptic focus by surgically placing electrodes within the skull (often referred to as GRID patients) on or within the brain, with the goal of being able to resect the area that is causing seizures. To identify where seizure originate electrically, it requires that seizures occur during the vEEG procedure. To provoke seizures, medications are typically lowered, and both partial seizures and those with secondary generalization to full tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures will occur. Prior research has shows that oxygen desaturation below 90% occurs with some complex partial seizures, but hypoxia is more common and more profound with GTCs. Some centers use oxygen saturation and CO2 monitors as their standard of care, and at NYULMC the investigators also have the capability for both for clinical usage.

Oxygen is not currently a mandated standard-of-care, but is often provided by nasal prongs following seizures as part of the post-ictal nursing care, though there is no outcome data to support its use. It is unknown whether pre-treatment with oxygen will reduce the rate of oxygen desaturations clinically, as seen in animal models, and this is the goal of this research project.",Epilepsy,OTHER: oxygen,"Oxygen desaturation below 92% following GTCs, during and up to 6 minutes following the seizure",NYU Langone Health,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,5,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2013-08,2014-08,"NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, New York, 10016, United States"
