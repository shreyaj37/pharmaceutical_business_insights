It is unknown how these mutations affect the physiology of parvalbumin-positive (PV)inhibitory interneurons a critical inhibitory interneuron subtype that expresses Nav1.6.

Nav1.6 is expressedin both excitatory and inhibitory neurons and plays a critical role in action potential (AP) generation andpropagation in both. Multiple previous studies have indicated that a gain-of-function Nav1.6 mutant results inhyperexcitability of excitatory cells. However significantly less is known about how mutant Nav1.6 may impactinhibitory interneurons. Proper function of inhibitory interneurons is essential to constrain activity of excitatoryneurons and their dysfunction has been linked to various genetic epilepsy syndromes. The most numerousinhibitory interneuron subtypes are parvalbumin-positive (PV) and somatostatin-positive (SST) interneurons.Previous work in our lab has shown deficits in SST interneurons in models of SCN8A EE. PV interneurons playa crucial role in Dravet Syndrome a genetic epilepsy syndrome caused by mutations in the sodium channelNav1.1 and they may play a role in temporal lobe epilepsy. Despite this there have been no studies in theSCN8A EE field examining the effect of mutant Nav1.6 expression on PV interneuron physiology and the rolethat they may play in seizures. Using global (Scn8aD/+) and conditional (Scn8aW/+-PV; expression solely in PVinterneurons) mouse models of SCN8A EE this proposal seeks to test whether PV interneuron excitability isaffected by mutant Nav1.6 and if this impacts overall network excitability and seizure susceptibility. Mypreliminary data suggest that PV interneurons possessing mutant Nav1.6 have increased persistent sodiumcurrents and reduced excitability at high-firing frequencies via a state of action potential failure known asdepolarization block. I have also observed that conditional expression of a patient derived SCN8A mutationsolely in PV interneurons leads to spontaneous seizures in mice further indicating the importance of thisinterneuron subtype within SCN8A EE. In aim 1 of this proposal I will record WT Scn8aD/+ and Scn8aW/+ PVinterneurons to characterize any alterations in the intrinsic excitability voltage-gated sodium currents andsynaptic physiology of PV interneurons. This will clarify the impact of gain-of-function SCN8A mutations on PVinterneuron function and network excitability. In aim 2 using a Cre-dependent shRNA I will test whethergenetic knockdown of Nav1.6 specifically in PV interneurons will rescue their aberrant excitability and if this willimpact seizure frequency in Scn8aD/+ mice. Overall completion of these aims will allow for a comprehensivecharacterization of PV interneurons in SCN8A EE and will assess whether the specific targeting of theseinterneurons might provide a novel therapeutic target.,38001

GBM metastasizes to different brain regions which makes surgical resectiondifficult. Despite radiation therapy and chemotherapy the median survival timeline is dire at 15months. The major challenges in GBM therapy include late diagnosis metastasis resistance tochemotherapeutics and drug delivery issues due to blood-brain barrier. Thus efforts towardsdeveloping novel pharmacotherapies for GBM are highly warranted. Cancer cells rewire theirmetabolic pathways that are intimately linked to oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Themetabolic reprogramming confers GBM several advantages in survival proliferation metastasisdrug resistance and immune evasion. In addition recent research in the cancer metabolism fieldhas revealed an important lactate shuttle that explains the key role of lactate transfer fromsystemic circulation into tumor microenvironment. Lactate utilization is highly relevant for braintumors such as GBM. Our long-term goal is to pharmacologically target tumor metabolicreprogramming for cancer therapy. Towards that goal we screened a number of metabolicinhibitors in GBM cells that uncovered effectiveness of an FDA-approved antiepileptic drugstiripentol with its putative target lactate dehydrogenase. The objective of this study is to elucidatemolecular mechanism and changes in cancer biology by stiripentol treatment in GBM cells andGBM in vivo models. In addition we will study structure-activity relationships of novel derivativesidentified from stiripentol scaffold to develop potent inhibitors. Additionally formulations ofstiripentol and potent lead compounds will be developed and tested in the tumor xenograft modelof U87 xenografts. Our research will offer novel insights in the mechanistic pharmacology ofstiripentol and can lead to the development of candidate therapeutics for GBM treatment.,164000

A growing proportion of pediatric epilepsies are tied to causative variants in ion channel genes includingthe voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN2A. The 2020 Epilepsy Research Benchmarks of NINDS prioritizeidentifying how genetic variants cause epilepsy and related neurodevelopmental disorders. SCN2A variants thatmanifest with loss-of-function are associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders and late-onset epilepsy.On the other hand gain-of-function SCN2A variants predominantly have a phenotype of early-onset epilepsy.The encoded sodium channel (NaV1.2) is highly expressed in excitatory glutamatergic neurons early indevelopment presenting a unique opportunity to examine how excitatory neuron dysfunction leads to early-onsetepilepsy. Animal and human tissue-derived neuron models have brought mechanistic insight to how Dravetsyndrome results in interneuron dysfunction and epilepsy. Among SCN2A-related diseases animal modelsilluminate how loss-of-function leads to autism spectrum disorder with late-onset epilepsy. Due to lack of readilyavailable disease models there is sparse mechanistic understanding of how excitatory neuron dysfunction earlyin development leads to early-onset epilepsy. This proposal will exploit two early-onset epilepsy variants ofSCN2A that have a convergent clinical phenotype yet divergent biophysical mechanisms. Patient-derived neuronmodels and mouse models provide the opportunity to define the point of mechanistic convergence at multiplescales: from single neurons to neural circuits influencing epilepsy phenotype. Aim 1 will determine how two gain-of-function SCN2A variants encoding missense mutations M1879T and E430A confer increased excitability bydistinct mechanisms. Functional analysis of iPSC-derived neurons in isolation and in elementary circuits willdefine how the different variants impact excitability and thus converge toward an epileptic phenotype. Aim 2 willdefine hippocampal higher-level circuit perturbations in epileptic mice designed with genome editing torecapitulate the SCN2A-E430A human epileptic encephalopathy. Ex vivo analysis of changes in excitabilitysynaptic signaling and network output in the hippocampus will lead to new understanding of how gain-of-functionSCN2A variants affect neuronal networks. EEG and depth electrodes will provide spatiotemporal correlate to thein vivo epilepsy phenotype.

Over 1000 loss-of-function mutations in the VGSC SCN1A have been identifiedduring the last two decades and are the main cause of Dravet syndrome (DS) characterized by recurrent early-life febrile seizures (FSs) severe afebrile epilepsy cognitive and behavioral deficits and a 15-20% mortalityrate. Mutations in the VGSC SCN8A were more recently identified in 2012 and already over 200 gain-of-functionSCN8A mutations have been reported in patients with a range of clinical features including catastrophictreatment-resistant childhood epilepsy autism intellectual disability and developmental delay. Unfortunatelymost anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) fail to adequately treat the broad range of severe seizures and behavioralphenotypes in patients with SCN1A- and SCN8A-derived epilepsy. Thus despite recent progress inpharmacological treatments for DS there remains a need to develop more effective longer lasting treatmentswith fewer side effects. Neuropeptides are well known in animal studies to show great promise for controllingseizures and ameliorating behavioral abnormalities; however they do not readily cross the blood brain barrierand are rapidly metabolized when given systemically. Thus poor brain penetrance is a critical barrier to theclinical application of these promising therapeutics. To overcome this challenge we developed and validated anapproach based on the encapsulation of neuropeptides in nanoparticles conjugated to rabies virus glycoprotein(RVG). Using this approach we have found that intranasal delivery of nanoparticle-encapsulated oxytocin (NP-OT) greatly increases brain penetrance and the capacity of OT to confer robust and sustained increases inresistance to seizures in mouse models of SCN1A and SCN8A dysfunction. We have also extended our strategyto encapsulate neuropeptide Y (NP-NPY) and similarly observed a robust improvement in its ability to conferseizure resistance. In the proposed study we will establish the ability of NP-OT and NP-NPY to amelioratespontaneous seizures and behavioral abnormalities in Scn1a and Scn8a mouse mutants (Aim 1). While the roleof OT in social behavior is well-studied less is known about the mechanisms by which it modulates seizuresusceptibility. Thus we will also identify the cellular and neural circuit mechanisms that contribute to the abilityof OT to increase seizure resistance in the Scn1a and Scn8a mutants (Aim 2). Our long-term goal is to developsafe and effective approaches for the brain delivery of neuropeptides for the treatment of epilepsy and otherneurological disorders.,457373

Avenues of controlling RNA degradation include induced proximity degradation orsplicing modulated nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Induced proximity degradation is a strategywhere a bifunctional drug binds a target RNA via a small molecule (SM) entity on one arm andinduces selective RNA degradation via a ribonuclease on the other arm. Therapeutic modulationof NMD via RNA splicing is another strategy to selectively control RNA degradation. Early-stageRNA degradation drug discovery has been hindered by current high-throughput screening (HTS)assay technologies designed for protein targets. Specifically cell-based drug screens useminigene reporters that rely on luciferase or fluorescent protein signals for assay read-out.Minigene reporter design is straightforward but minigene reporter requires mRNA export to thecytosol and protein translation. This significantly increases the rate of false hits per screen sincecompounds that inhibit global protein translation machinery or RNA export will also impactreporter read-out. Further protein-based reporters cannot be used to study nuclear RNA or non-coding RNA turnover and in diseases with nuclear export defects. Thus there is an unmet needfor a cell-based HTS assay platform that monitors selected RNA turnover directly reflects real-time RNA dynamics and compatible for different types of RNA. A prime example where apreviously intractable disease can be unlocked by RNA degrading drugs is the G4C2hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene  the most frequent genetic cause ofamyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is now known that thetoxic gain-of-function from the expanded G4C2 repeats induces ALS/FTD pathology. Antisenseoligonucleotides (ASOs) designed to bind either the G4C2 sequences or intronic regionsdownstream of the repeat sequences showed reduction in disease phenotypes in C9orf72 models.However ASOs can trigger immune responses and suffer from tissue delivery issues. A cell-based assay that can report expanded transcript turnover to identify effective C9orf72 RNA gain-of-function SM inhibitors will have high commercial potential. The goals of this Phase I SBIRapplication will be cell-based RNA degradation reporters for validated RNA targets inneurodegenerative diseases. The results will form the foundation of an HTS assay platform forearly-stage discovery SMs that modulate RNA stability.,392116

Synaptic integration and plasticity are the cellular mechanisms of information pro-cessing learning and memory. How these fundamental processes are disrupted in epilepsy is not understood.Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus/Dravet syndrome (GEFS+/DS) is a spectrum of epilepsy disor-ders linked to mutations of the SCN1B gene which cause seizures neurodevelopmental delays and early death.To develop treatments for seizures/cognitive deficits of GEFS+/DS epilepsies there is a critical need to identifymechanisms by which SCN1B mutations disrupt cellular-level information processing and learning. Our long-term goal is to define general principles linking genes to disrupted synaptic integration and plasticity in suchneurodevelopmental disorders. The overall objective of our proposal is to define how the interplay between syn-apses dendritic physiology and somatic physiology impair synaptic integration and plasticity in the Scn1b knock-out (KO) mouse model of GEFS+/DS. Our central hypothesis is loss of Scn1b dysregulates ion channels anddendrite excitability disturbing integration and plasticity. To test this hypothesis we will complete three Aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms of somatic and dendritic hyperexcitability in Scn1b KO neurons.Based on preliminary data our hypothesis is that both dendrites and somata of Scn1b KO CA1 pyramidal neu-rons exhibit intrinsic hyperexcitability in part due to abnormal HCN channel activity. We will test this hypothesiswith whole cell somatic and dendritic recordings immunohistochemistry and cell morphology analyses. Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms of altered synaptic integration in Scn1b KO neurons. Based on ourpreliminary data our hypothesis is that loss of Scn1b fundamentally alters the translation of inputs into outputswith both temporal and spatial synaptic integration abnormally enhanced due to dendritic hyperexcitability anddisrupted synaptic physiology. We will use whole cell recordings to test how temporal and spatial features ofinput/output functions are altered in Scn1b KO neurons in response to naturalistic patterns of synaptic inputs. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that Scn1b disruption alters synaptic learning rules and gating by GABAthat dictate plasticity. Based on our preliminary data our hypothesis is that synaptic learning rules governingLTP and LTD induction are re-shaped due to interplay between suppressed excitation hyperexcitable intrinsicproperties and abnormal gating by aberrant depolarizing inhibition after loss of Scn1b. We will test how inputpatterns that evoke LTP and LTD shift after loss of Scn1b and how inhibition influences this plasticity. Upon successful completion of the proposed research we will have defined detailed mechanisms by whichchanges in neuron intrinsic and synaptic physiology and their interactions re-shape the cellular forms of neuralprocessing and learning in the Scn1b KO mouse model of GEFS+/DS. This contribution will provide mechanisticlinks between genetic changes primary neurophysiology phenotypes and neuronal processing deficits underly-ing seizures and the learning memory and cognition impairments in GEFS+/DS epilepsies.,356742

This causes a decrease in the release of inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA)resulting in hyperexcitability. The disease manifests itself within the first year of life and is usually triggered byhyperthermia causing frequent and prolonged seizures that result in a host of health problems includingdevelopmental delay speech impairment ataxia hypotonia and sleep disturbances. Two small molecule monotherapies have been approved recently by the FDA: Epidiolex (Cannabidiol orCBD) in 2018 and Fintepla (fenfluramine or FA) in 2020 for patients two years of age and older. Even thoughthey reduce the frequency of seizures these drugs at their effective dosages cause multiple side effects. Theirmechanism(s) of action to reduce epileptiform activity remain(s) unknown. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels have been strongly implicated in epilepsy. They areactivated by the G dimer of G proteins and by [Na+]i in a synergistic manner. The basis of synergism lies inthat they each work allosterically to control predominantly the two channel gates: G the membrane gate andNa+ the cytosolic gate. In the case of the GABAergic interneurons we hypothesize that NaV1.1 and GIRK1/2are coupled such that the Na+ entering through NaV1.1 promotes GIRK1/2 activity to hyperpolarize the cell andensure removal of NaV1.1 inactivation for fast spiking. In DS this mechanism becomes compromised causingcell depolarization and inactivation of voltage-gated channels at large present in GABAergic neurons failing tocompensate for the loss of NaV1.1. We use GAT1508 a specific activator of GIRK1/2 to compensate for thecompromised Na+ entry. Since GAT1508 opens the cytosolic gate we ask whether it synergizes with CBD (viaCB1R) and FA (via 5-HT1DR) to open more fully the membrane gates. In Aim 1 experiments designed to testthe hypothesis are aimed at the cellular level in both heterologous expression and in native GABAergic neurons.In Aims 2 and 3 we utilize a DS mouse model heterozygous for the Scn1a gene that encodes NaV1.1 and inAim 2 we test the hypothesis at the brain slice level where synapses and transmitter release remain intact andcompare the DS model to a wild-type animal model. In Aim 3 we pursue experiments at the whole animal level(DS model) using simultaneous EEG and 2-photon microscopy to monitor the neuronal circuits involved.,553433

Our recent investigation of zebrafish mutants featuring a loss-of-function sodium channel (scn1a)mutation (e.g. a gene mutation identified in ~80% of DS patients) focused on drug discovery anddevelopment metabolic dysfunction and behavioral comorbidities. Using a high-throughput phenotype-basedscreening strategy and medicinal chemistry we screened nearly 3000 drugs successfully identified aserotonin (5HT) receptor mechanism underlying anti-seizure activity of clemizole and developed three novelclemizole analogs. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology we generated new zebrafish mutant linesfor chd2 gabrb3 pcdh19 and stxbp1 (e.g. de novo mutations seen in ~20% of DS patients). Interestinglystxbp1 and gabrb3 mutants exhibit epileptic phenotypes. We also designed and manufactured a microfluidicmulti-channel electrode-integrated platform for long-term non-invasive electrophysiology on larval zebrafish(Hong et al. 2016) and developed a calcium imaging-analysis pipeline for studying seizure macro- and micro-networks in vivo (Liu and Baraban 2019). The proposed work will leverage these unique tools. Three specificaims are proposed: (i) to resolve neural networks responsible for seizures in larval DS zebrafish (ii) to performhigh-throughput drug screening using zebrafish and (iii) to further evaluate clemizole and related anti-seizurecompounds. Techniques will include automated locomotion tracking in vivo zebrafish electrophysiologypharmacology and fast calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium- and voltage-sensitive indicators.Our results promise to simultaneously advance our long-term goals (i) to better understand thepathophysiology of genetic epilepsies and (ii) identify promising new treatment options for these intractableconditions.,494954

SUDEPmechanisms are not understood although there is evidence to implicate apnea autonomic dysfunction andcardiac arrhythmias. Our work in mice led to the hypothesis that cardiac arrhythmias contribute to the mechanismof SUDEP in channelopathy-linked genetic epilepsies. We demonstrated altered cardiac myocyte (CM) ioniccurrents calcium handling and action potentials (APs) as well as cardiac arrhythmias in mouse models ofSCN1A- SCN8A- and SCN1B-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). We showed thatinduced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived CMs from Dravet syndrome (DS) patients have substrates forarrhythmias. Importantly no animal or iPSC model can completely replicate the human DS phenotype. Becausemouse and human cardiac APs are very different we used human iPSC-CM models to investigate cellautonomous effects of SCN1A haploinsufficiency. However cells in 2-dimensional culture cannot replicatecomplex cardiac tissues cardiovascular changes or cardiac innervation. Here we will develop and validate alarge animal model in which the role of cardiac arrhythmias in addition to seizures in SUDEP can beinvestigated. Rabbits closely replicate the human cardiac AP and provide a complete organism to translate tothe clinical setting. Our objective is to develop and validate a transgenic rabbit model of SCN1A-linked DS. Wegenerated a New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit Scn1a deletion model using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.However NZW Scn1a+/- rabbits showed neither seizures nor cardiac arrhythmia. We later found that F1: NZW xDutch Belted Scn1a+/- rabbits have seizures cardiac arrhythmia and premature death. These exciting resultssuggest that we may have generated the first transgenic large animal model of a DEE although this model mustnow be rigorously validated. If validated this work will be a significant advance over currently available DSmodels. R61 Phase Specific Aims: 1. To characterize seizure onset seizure types seizure frequency andduration and determine the rate of SUDEP in DS rabbits. 2. To characterize arrhythmia types frequency andduration whether arrhythmias occur independently of seizures and whether cardiac arrhythmia is associatedwith SUDEP in DS rabbits. R33 Phase Specific Aim: To validate the model using the ASO drug STK-001 or thedrug combination stiripentol + clobazam to reduce seizures and SUDEP. Establishing a genetic rabbit model ofDS will better inform the translatability of neuro-cardiac mechanisms of SUDEP to human disease.,354129

Mutations in SCN1Aencoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 are the most common genetic cause of epilepsy.Over 1600 SCN1A mutations have been reported in individuals with epilepsy of varying severity ranging frommild febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome a severe infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy caused byheterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Dravet syndrome is characterized by a variety of seizure typesdevelopmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variableexpressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by geneticmodifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) recapitulate core features of Dravet syndromephenotypes including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reducedsodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons resulting in failure of inhibition and excitatory/inhibitoryimbalance in the brain. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is strongly dependent on strain background. Scn1a+/-mice on the resistant 129 strain (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrastScn1a+/- mice on a [129xB6]F1 strain (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality with50% dying by 1 month of age. Strain-dependent differences are also evident at the level of neuron subtypes.GABAergic interneurons isolated from the susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased sodium current densitycompared to wildtype littermates while sodium current density is preserved in interneurons isolated from129.Scn1a+/- relative to wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for theloss of Nav1.1 while F1 interneurons do not. Based on the strain-dependent difference in phenotypes at thewhole animal and cellular levels we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severitydue to differences in compensatory capacity among neuronal subtypes in the context of Scn1a heterozygousdeletion. We previously mapped several Dravet survival modifier (Dsm) loci that influence premature lethality ofScn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal we will address our hypothesis in three aims. First we will perform finemapping and candidate gene analysis at two Dsm loci on mouse chromosomes 7 and 8. Second we will performsingle cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize differences in cell composition and gene expression in specific cellsubpopulations during the critical phase of phenotype onset in epilepsy susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant129.Scn1a+/- mice. Third we will evaluate the modifier potential of candidate genes in vivo using transcriptionalmodulation to up- and down-regulate candidate gene expression. Results from these studies will identify modifiergenes and pathways that influence phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Identification of modifier genes thatinfluence severity of Dravet syndrome will provide insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and will suggestnovel therapeutic approaches for improved treatment of human patients.,472020

Respiratoryfailure is a leading cause of SUDEP and DS patients' frequently exhibit disordered breathing.However mechanisms underlying respiratory dysfunction in DS are unknown. Evidencesuggests cortical seizures activate inhibitory projections to suppress brainstem function andresult in death; however a yet unexplored possibility is that DS-associated mutations directlyaffect brainstem respiratory centers and serve as a common substrate for both seizure andrespiratory dysfunction. We recently showed that Scn1a transcript is highly expressed inbrainstem inhibitory neurons and expression of a DS-associated Scn1a mutation (A1783V) ininhibitory neurons resulted in cell autonomous loss of neural activity and disruption ofrespiratory function at the cellular and whole-animal levels. Therefore I hypothesize that loss ofScn1a function directly impacts brainstem respiratory control. To test this I will disrupt Scn1afunction globally (Scn1a-/+) specifically in all VGAT+ inhibitory neurons and only in glycinergicneurons (GlyT2:A1783V) and determine whether these animals exhibit disordered breathingseizures or premature death (Aim 1) and altered cellular activity of respiratory neurons (Aim 2).This work will provide novel insight into roles of glycinergic neurons in DS and determine theextent to which loss of Scn1a function directly affect brainstem function.,46740

Clinical and animal studies show that seizure-induced respiratoryarrest is the primary event leading to death. Increased serotonin (5-HT) levels in the brain reduce seizure-induced respiratory arrest in provoked seizure models. However it is unclear whether enhancing 5-HT neuro-transmission exerts protective effects on seizure-induced sudden death in spontaneous seizure (epilepsy)models and which 5-HT circuitry is involved in this sudden death in both provoked and spontaneous seizuremodels. These gaps in knowledge have significantly hindered the therapeutics to prevent SUDEP in patients.The long-term goal is to foster effective prevention strategies against SUDEP using approaches targeted tospecific SUDEP mechanisms. The overall objectives of this proposal are to (1) determine the efficacy of 5-HT-enhancing agents in suppressing seizure-induced sudden death and (2) elucidate the involved 5-HT circuitrymechanisms in animal models especially in a widely-used mouse model of human Dravet syndrome (a type ofepilepsy) that displays spontaneous seizures with a high rate of seizure-induced sudden death. The centralhypothesis is that enhanced 5-HT signaling prevents seizure-induced sudden death and that the 5-HT raphe-amygdala circuitry is involved in this sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. The rationale for this proposal isthat a determination of preclinical therapeutic efficacy of 5-HT-enhancing agents and 5-HT neuronal circuitrymechanisms in seizure-induced sudden death is likely to offer a strong scientific framework by which newstrategies against human SUDEP can be developed. The central hypothesis will be tested in the following twospecific aims: 1) Determine the protective effects of enhancing 5-HT neurotransmission on seizure-inducedsudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice; and 2) Elucidate how 5-HT circuitry from raphe nuclei to the amygda-la modifies seizure-induced sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. We will employ a combination of simul-taneous video EEG/ECG/plethysmography monitoring electrophysiology pharmacology and cell-type specifictechnologies (optogenetics and DREADDs) to perform the work in these aims. The proposed research is inno-vative because it defines a novel 5-HT circuitry mechanism of seizure-induced sudden death using optogenet-ics and DREADDs in animal models especially in a human disease model which could conceptually advancethe knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms of SUDEP. The proposed work is significant becausethe expected outcomes will potentially foster targeted pharmacologic and neurostimulatory interventions ofSUDEP to save lives of at-risk patients.,363131

Seizures may impair arousal to important stimuli such asCO2 to contribute to SUDEP.

SUDEP is second only to stroke in years of potential life lost to neurological disease and is amajor public health problem. Several etiologies have been proposed for SUDEP including cardiac andrespiratory dysregulation. Another that is postulated is impaired arousal. Seizures impair arousal. Amongarousal stimuli one that may be particularly relevant to SUDEP is CO2. CO2 rises following seizures andis part of the seizure cessation mechanism. Seizures are frequently associated with ictal and post-ictalcentral and obstructive apneas. Apnea further exacerbates the accumulation of CO2. Impairment of CO2-arousal is proposed as an etiological factor in another sudden death entity sudden infant deathsyndrome which has many parallels with SUDEP. We discovered that seizures impaired CO2-arousal inseizure nave mice and those that do not have a particularly profound death rate. Whether this is true inmouse models with strong SUDEP phenotypes is unknown. Thus our goal in this proposal is to determinehow seizures in different sleep states impair CO2-arousal in mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy(TLE) and the genetic epileptic encephalopathy Dravet Syndrome (DS). In Aim 1 we will determine theextent to which CO2-arousal is impaired in epilepsy models. We will focus on the pilocarpine-TLE modelas many patients that die of SUDEP have TLE and the DS model as patients with DS have adisproportionately high SUDEP risk. We will also determine whether simply having epilepsy in thesemodels impairs CO2-arousal as a potential easily measurable biomarker for SUDEP risk. In Aim 2 we willdetermine whether neuronal function assessed via fiber photometry of arousal system components inthe dorsal raphe nucleus and parabrachial nucleus two important contributors to sleep-wake regulationand key nodes in CO2-arousal is impaired by seizures and epilepsy. In Aim 3 we will determine whetheroptogenetically stimulating a DRN-PBN circuit in DS mice using a novel mouse model prior to seizuresprevents seizure-induced death lending direct insights into possible therapeutic measures. Since themodels employed have known death rates we will be able to compare findings between mice that dieand those that survive making these studies more relevant to SUDEP. Combining these findings with ourprevious work we will have a powerful rigorous translatable approach to identify convergent anddivergent mechanisms across models for how impaired CO2-arousal in epilepsy contributes to SUDEPrisk. We expect to be able to leverage these mechanisms to identify at-risk individuals and reduce deathfrom this devastating disease.,504578

Dravet syndrome (DS) which results from a loss of function of the sodium channel (NaV)isoform NaV1.1 is associated with a particularly high risk of SUDEP. Notably the unexpected mortality of SUDEPmirrors cases of sudden cardiac death (SCD)  unexpected death resulting from cardiac arrhythmias. Emergingevidence points to physiological commonalities between the brain and the heart suggesting that the verymolecular mechanisms that underlie epileptic disorders could also directly impact the heart leading to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and thereby SCD. However the precise mechanisms by which DS directlyimpact the heart to promote cardiac arrhythmias and SCD remain unknown. Thus we propose to utilize modelsof DS to address this gap in knowledge and to explore the role of direct cardiac remodeling in SCD. Using thesemodels we will test the hypothesis that defects in NaVs that underlie inherited epileptic disorders such as Dravetsyndrome dysregulate cardiac Na+/Ca2+ cycling thereby promoting life-threatening arrhythmias and contributingto SCD. Thus we propose to: 1) Define the phenotypic and structural impacts of tissue-specific expression ofDS-associated defects. 2) Determine the functional impact of DS-associated Na+/Ca2+ signaling nanodomainremodeling on cardiac Ca2+ handling. 3) Assess efficacy of targeting Na+/Ca2+ signaling nanodomains for SCDprevention. Information gleaned from these studies will be used to develop new therapeutic approaches to treatSCD in DS.,412015

For over a century neuroscientistshave categorized brain cell types by their features including shape position physiology molecules andfunction. Single cell transcriptomics studies are now defining molecular cell types at a resolution not previouslypossible uncovering a taxonomy of hundreds to thousands of brain cell types. These studies have also revealeddramatic differences in molecular signatures of homologous cell types across species showing decisively thatthe difference between mouse and human brain is not simply the total number of neurons. However the functionof each cell class or type in brain circuitry and dysfunction in disease is only beginning to be evaluated. Tocharacterize the roles of human brain cell classes in normal function and disease it is critical that tools bedeveloped to allow genetic access to cell classes in vivo. Such tools would enable precise therapeutic genedelivery to brain cell classes permitting targeted treatment for class-specific etiologies like some epilepsies.Few genetic tools are available to mark and manipulate cell classes and types in non-genetically tractablespecies like human and non-human primate (NHP). Viruses including adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)containing cell class and type selective enhancers can be leveraged to gain genetic access to and drive geneexpression in specific brain cell classes in these species. We have initiated a project through the BRAIN Initiativeto generate and validate reporter AAVs to mark specific cell classes in the mouse cortex in vivo and in humanneocortical tissue ex vivo. Our groups have engineered AAV vectors and optimized capsids to access neuronsand express transgenes in many discrete cell classes and types in mouse and primate. New and improved AAVtools promise to fuel human brain scientific discovery and clinical progress but one impediment has been thecostly and time-consuming process of validating new vectors in primates.We present three Aims to translate these promising new AAV vectors into a high-value set of primate-optimizedtools that could eventually be used for gene therapies in humans. First we will develop a platform for screeningAAV vectors in NHP ex vivo brain slices followed by individual validation of promising vectors in NHP in vivoand human ex vivo brain slice cultures. Second we will identify optimal AAV capsids to: a) support widespreadNHP neuronal transduction in vivo when applied intravenously or to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) two preferredroutes of delivery for human CNS gene therapy and b) support AAV transduction of human primary brain tissueex vivo. Third we will perform proof-of-concept experiments using cell class-selective vectors to express atherapeutic transgene in defined classes to treat a severe and intractable form of childhood epilepsy calledDravet syndrome (DS). These experiments represent a significant step towards converting cell class-selectiveAAVs into first-in-class viral tools optimized for in vivo NHP brain studies and human gene therapy applications.,901932

Many of these diseases are disabling or even life threatening with no availabletreatment. The underlying molecular mechanisms vary. Both loss of gene function and gain of toxic or dominantnegative effects can lead to pathology and modification of gene expression could be disease modifying. DAYITherapeutics Inc is a spin-out of Columbia University Medical Center that has the goal of advancing preciselytargeted RNA therapeutics for the treatment of rare monogenic diseases especially neurological disordersaffecting the brain and behavior. Using a proprietary target discovery platform developed by our academic co-founders we have prioritized a list of target genes causing severe neurodevelopmental disorders withtremendous unmet medical needs. These target genes are in general difficult to target with current approachesbut are druggable with our unique technology to identify endogenous naturally occurring gene regulatory regionsthat can be targeted by different therapeutic modalities including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). In thisproposal we aim to develop the first therapeutic for a severe developmental and intellectual disability syndromeby restoring gene expression and protein function using an ASO. The feasibility of our approach is supportedby compelling preliminary data. We propose to perform a systematic ASO drug screen to identify the mosteffective ASOs as drug lead and then conduct a series of pre-clinical studies to validate their efficacy in correctingthe molecular cellular and behavioral deficits caused by the mutation using patient-derived iPSCs brainorganoids and mouse models. ASOs are an established therapeutic agent with the advantage of high targetspecificity clear mode of action and accelerated timeline from drug discovery to clinical deployment. Ifsuccessful this study will provide the critical first step to develop a novel ASO therapeutic to fulfill unmet medicalneeds and potentially also serve as proof of principle for treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders caused bymutations in a wide range of genes.,299546

The proposed work investigates the role of NaV1.1 inthe transmission of gustatory signals with particular regard to its role in mediating sweet taste.

RNA-seq transcriptomic data shows that NaV1.1 is expressed insubsets of ganglion cells thought to transmit particular taste qualities including sweet. My preliminarybehavioral and electrophysiological studies also suggest that NaV1.1 may mediate sweet taste signaltransmission both in an acute i.e. pharmacological block mouse model as well as in a genetic model of NaV1.1haploinsufficiency. In this proposal three different mouse models  one acute and two genetic  will beassessed on peripheral gustatory deficits (Aim 1) and behavioral effects (Aim 2) due to Nav1.1 dysfunction. Thisstudy is innovative because our preliminary data suggest that 1) a single type of sodium channel maydifferentially impact transmission of particular taste qualities and 2) gustatory function may serve as asurrogate measure for NaV1.1 function. The latter would be particularly useful for assessing phenotype severityin Dravet patients which as of yet does not have a robust biomarker to use in assessment.,35461

Such disorders severely impact the emotional social physical and economicwellbeing of patients and their caregivers and a poor understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of thesedisorders has slowed the discovery of effective therapies. There is evidence however that neurodevelopmentaldisorders as a class are associated with selective dysfunction of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in thecerebral cortex.Dravet Syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in the SCN1A gene encoding the Nav1.1 voltage-gated sodiumchannel a subunit is a canonical example of a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by interneuron dysfunctionas interneurons in the neocortex preferentially rely on Nav1.1 for action potential generation and propagation.Importantly cerebral cortical interneurons are a functionally heterogenous population; therefore understandingthe contribution of different classes of interneurons to microcircuit function in normal brain and dysfunction inthe setting of pathology is essential for further elucidating the mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders.In this proposal I will determine the function or dysfunction of the least studied major population of neocorticalinterneurons those expressing Neuron-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (Ndnf) within cerebral cortical microcircuitsin Dravet Syndrome. These cells are enriched in layer 1 of neocortex where they are thought to play a role insensory processing and regulating inhibitory tone in the cortex. Using a clinically-relevant and well-characterizedmouse model of Dravet Syndrome I will first establish the electrophysiologic synaptic and morphologicproperties of Ndnf-expressing interneurons in Scn1a+/- mice relative to wild-type mice in vitro (Aim 1). I will thendetermine the behavior of these cells within cortical microcircuits in Scn1a+/- mice relative to wild-type in vivousing multiphoton imaging and optogenetic approaches (Aim 2). This proposal will not only provide novel dataon an understudied interneuron subtype both in health and disease but also provide training in a suite ofadvanced electrophysiologic and optical techniques that will serve to train the applicant towards a future careeras a physician-scientist studying circuit dysfunction in neurological disorders and development of new therapiesand cures.,47694

The majority of NDD-associated SNVs affect a single allele of a geneleading to haploinsufficiency. Correcting haploinsufficiency by increasing the expression level of the deficientallele could provide an attractive strategy for NDDs treatment. A variant of CRISPR CRISPRa (CRISPRactivation) offers the possibility to modulate the expression of endogenous genes by directly targeting theirpromoters or enhancers. Here we are proposing to apply CRISPRa to upregulate the levels of Cul3 ubiquitinligase a high-confidence gene for NDDs. We have recently generated a haploinsufficient Cul3 mouse model.Brain MRI found decreased volume of cortical regions starting from early postnatal development and persistinginto adulthood. Spatiotemporal transcriptomic and proteomic profiling implicated cytoskeletal and synapticdefects as key drivers of Cul3 functional impact. Specifically dendritic growth filamentous actin puncta andspontaneous network activity measured by multielectrode arrays (MEA) were reduced in Cul3 mutant mice. Cul3mutant mice also exhibited hyperactive behavior along with social and cognitive deficits. We hypothesize thatupregulation of Cul3 dosage early in development with CRSIPRa will rescue some (or all) of the observedphenotypes and will lay the basis for general therapeutic interventions in NDDs. The goal of this projectis to demonstrate the feasibility of compensating for Cul3 haploinsufficiency by rebalancing neuronal molecularcellular and network activity phenotypes. We will achieve this goal through the following Specific Aims: (1) Toevaluate rescue potential of cellular and molecular phenotypes in the Cul3+/- CRISPRa mice; (2) To evaluaterescue potential of brain architecture and cognitive deficits in Cul3+/- CRISPRa mice. Our study will represent aneffective strategy for rebalancing Cul3 (and potentially other NDD genes) deficiency and correcting associatedphenotypes.,197500

SUDEPmechanisms are not understood although there is evidence to implicate apnea autonomic dysfunction andcardiac arrhythmias. We will take advantage of recent progress in the understanding of SUDEP risk in the geneticepilepsies to investigate the role of cardiac arrhythmias. SUDEP risk varies in a gene-specific manner. Loss-of-function variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) genes SCN1A or SCN1B are identified inpatients with Dravet syndrome (DS) and gain-of-function variants in the VGSC SCN8A are found in patients withEarly Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 13 (EIEE13). DS and EIEE13 patients have the highest SUDEP risk upto 20%. In contrast variants in chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) are also associated withearly onset EE but SUDEP has not been reported in this population. SCN1A- SCN1B- SCN8A- and CHD2-linked epilepsies are developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) severe childhood epilepsiesassociated with cognitive and behavioral impairments. The familial focal epilepsies are attributed to pathogenicvariants in DEPDC5 encoding a member of the GATOR complex in the mTOR pathway. SUDEP is reported in10% of these patients. Because VGSC genes are expressed in both heart and brain we have proposed thatcardiac arrhythmias contribute to the mechanism of SUDEP in channelopathy-linked genetic epilepsies. Ouroverall goal is to understand the mechanisms of SUDEP in the genetic epilepsies. Our objectives are to usepatient-derived or transgenic mouse cardiac myocytes (CMs) to understand how epileptic VGSC gene mutationsalter CM function and arrhythmogenic potential and to determine whether similar changes are found in non-ionchannel epilepsy genes that are expressed in the heart. Our central hypothesis is that both ion channel and non-ion channel genetic epilepsies with high but not low SUDEP risk exhibit pro-arrhythmogenic changes in patient-derived CMs and mouse models. To ask whether abnormal CM excitability also occurs in a non-ion channelgenetic epilepsy with high SUDEP risk we will investigate DEPDC5 variant iPSC-CMs and Depdc5-/- mice.Finally we will examine Chd2-/- mice and human iPSC-CMs with variants in CHD2 a non-ion channel gene witha low SUDEP risk to test whether altered CM excitability is specific to genetic epilepsies with high SUDEP rates.Like the VGSCs DEPDC5 and CHD2 are expressed in brain and heart. Our Specific Aims are: 1. To determinethe effects of SCN1A SCN1B and SCN8A epilepsy variants on CM excitability using patient-derived iPSC-CMs.2. To ascertain whether CMs from DEPDC5 patients or Depdc5+/- mice display abnormal excitability and whetherDepdc5+/- mice have arrhythmia. 3. To determine whether CMs from CHD2 patients or Chd2+/- mice displayabnormal excitability and whether Chd2+/- mice have arrhythmia. There are no effective therapies for any of thegenetic epilepsies and no reliable biomarkers for SUDEP risk. This work may lead to the discovery of diagnosticbiomarkers for SUDEP risk in the future.,693753

A growing proportion of pediatric epilepsies are tied to causative variants in ion channel genes includingthe voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN2A. The 2020 Epilepsy Research Benchmarks of NINDS prioritizeidentifying how genetic variants cause epilepsy and related neurodevelopmental disorders. SCN2A variants thatmanifest with loss-of-function are associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders and late-onset epilepsy.On the other hand gain-of-function SCN2A variants predominantly have a phenotype of early-onset epilepsy.The encoded sodium channel (NaV1.2) is highly expressed in excitatory glutamatergic neurons early indevelopment presenting a unique opportunity to examine how excitatory neuron dysfunction leads to early-onsetepilepsy. Animal and human tissue-derived neuron models have brought mechanistic insight to how Dravetsyndrome results in interneuron dysfunction and epilepsy. Among SCN2A-related diseases animal modelsilluminate how loss-of-function leads to autism spectrum disorder with late-onset epilepsy. Due to lack of readilyavailable disease models there is sparse mechanistic understanding of how excitatory neuron dysfunction earlyin development leads to early-onset epilepsy. This proposal will exploit two early-onset epilepsy variants ofSCN2A that have a convergent clinical phenotype yet divergent biophysical mechanisms. Patient-derived neuronmodels and mouse models provide the opportunity to define the point of mechanistic convergence at multiplescales: from single neurons to neural circuits influencing epilepsy phenotype. Aim 1 will determine how two gain-of-function SCN2A variants encoding missense mutations M1879T and E430A confer increased excitability bydistinct mechanisms. Functional analysis of iPSC-derived neurons in isolation and in elementary circuits willdefine how the different variants impact excitability and thus converge toward an epileptic phenotype. Aim 2 willdefine hippocampal higher-level circuit perturbations in epileptic mice designed with genome editing torecapitulate the SCN2A-E430A human epileptic encephalopathy. Ex vivo analysis of changes in excitabilitysynaptic signaling and network output in the hippocampus will lead to new understanding of how gain-of-functionSCN2A variants affect neuronal networks. EEG and depth electrodes will provide spatiotemporal correlate to thein vivo epilepsy phenotype.

This causes a decrease in the release of inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA)resulting in hyperexcitability. The disease manifests itself within the first year of life and is usually triggered byhyperthermia causing frequent and prolonged seizures that result in a host of health problems includingdevelopmental delay speech impairment ataxia hypotonia and sleep disturbances. Two small molecule monotherapies have been approved recently by the FDA: Epidiolex (Cannabidiol orCBD) in 2018 and Fintepla (fenfluramine or FA) in 2020 for patients two years of age and older. Even thoughthey reduce the frequency of seizures these drugs at their effective dosages cause multiple side effects. Theirmechanism(s) of action to reduce epileptiform activity remain(s) unknown. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels have been strongly implicated in epilepsy. They areactivated by the G dimer of G proteins and by [Na+]i in a synergistic manner. The basis of synergism lies inthat they each work allosterically to control predominantly the two channel gates: G the membrane gate andNa+ the cytosolic gate. In the case of the GABAergic interneurons we hypothesize that NaV1.1 and GIRK1/2are coupled such that the Na+ entering through NaV1.1 promotes GIRK1/2 activity to hyperpolarize the cell andensure removal of NaV1.1 inactivation for fast spiking. In DS this mechanism becomes compromised causingcell depolarization and inactivation of voltage-gated channels at large present in GABAergic neurons failing tocompensate for the loss of NaV1.1. We use GAT1508 a specific activator of GIRK1/2 to compensate for thecompromised Na+ entry. Since GAT1508 opens the cytosolic gate we ask whether it synergizes with CBD (viaCB1R) and FA (via 5-HT1DR) to open more fully the membrane gates. In Aim 1 experiments designed to testthe hypothesis are aimed at the cellular level in both heterologous expression and in native GABAergic neurons.In Aims 2 and 3 we utilize a DS mouse model heterozygous for the Scn1a gene that encodes NaV1.1 and inAim 2 we test the hypothesis at the brain slice level where synapses and transmitter release remain intact andcompare the DS model to a wild-type animal model. In Aim 3 we pursue experiments at the whole animal level(DS model) using simultaneous EEG and 2-photon microscopy to monitor the neuronal circuits involved.,595967

Dravet syndrome (DS) acatastrophic childhood epilepsy associated with de novo mutations in a voltage-activated sodiumchannel Nav1.1 is one of the most common genetic epilepsies. DS patients suffer with intractableearly-life seizures and debilitating comorbidities. Energy metabolism in comorbidities associatedwith DS remain virtually unexplored. To address this unmet need recent collaborative researchin our two laboratories revealed decreased glycolytic and oxygen consumption rates in a validatedzebrafish model of DS i.e. scn1Lab mutants. This was accompanied by downregulation of keyenzymes pck1 and pck2 in the gluconeogenesis pathway. Here we hypothesize that energydisruption occurs in DS due to glucose dysregulation resulting in seizures and/or comorbidities.The following aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine if pharmacologicalinhibition of pck1 and/or pck2 phenocopies metabolic and behavioral deficits in wildtype zebrafish.Aim 2 will determine if pharmacological manipulation of pck1 and/or pck2 is therapeutic inscn1Lab mutant zebrafish. These studies promise to provide a mechanistic explanation of themetabolic defects observed in DS and could suggest novel avenues for therapeutic intervention.,457317

GBM metastasizes to different brain regions which makes surgical resectiondifficult. Despite radiation therapy and chemotherapy the median survival timeline is dire at 15months. The major challenges in GBM therapy include late diagnosis metastasis resistance tochemotherapeutics and drug delivery issues due to blood-brain barrier. Thus efforts towardsdeveloping novel pharmacotherapies for GBM are highly warranted. Cancer cells rewire theirmetabolic pathways that are intimately linked to oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Themetabolic reprogramming confers GBM several advantages in survival proliferation metastasisdrug resistance and immune evasion. In addition recent research in the cancer metabolism fieldhas revealed an important lactate shuttle that explains the key role of lactate transfer fromsystemic circulation into tumor microenvironment. Lactate utilization is highly relevant for braintumors such as GBM. Our long-term goal is to pharmacologically target tumor metabolicreprogramming for cancer therapy. Towards that goal we screened a number of metabolicinhibitors in GBM cells that uncovered effectiveness of an FDA-approved antiepileptic drugstiripentol with its putative target lactate dehydrogenase. The objective of this study is to elucidatemolecular mechanism and changes in cancer biology by stiripentol treatment in GBM cells andGBM in vivo models. In addition we will study structure-activity relationships of novel derivativesidentified from stiripentol scaffold to develop potent inhibitors. Additionally formulations ofstiripentol and potent lead compounds will be developed and tested in the tumor xenograft modelof U87 xenografts. Our research will offer novel insights in the mechanistic pharmacology ofstiripentol and can lead to the development of candidate therapeutics for GBM treatment.,164000

About 30% of patients donot respond to current therapies. Thus a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive the disease arerequired. By analyzing the expression level of every gene in the rat hippocampus in 3 different epilepsymodels in 11 institutions and 3 time points after seizure induction we have found a core driver of long termgene changes in the epileptic brain. This complex is called Polycomb. This project will study the role ofPolycomb in the progression of epilepsy.,NINDS,10617699,6/1/2023 0:00,PA-18-484,5R01NS108756-05,5,R01,NS,108756,5, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",8/1/2019 0:00,5/31/2024 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BDCN-E(02)M], ,7052279,"ROOPRA, AVTAR S","DINGLEDINE, RAYMOND J",2,NEUROSCIENCES,161202122,LCLSJAGTNZQ7,161202122,LCLSJAGTNZQ7,US,43.068519,-89.400858,578503,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,MADISON,WI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,537151218,UNITED STATES,N,6/1/2023 0:00,5/31/2024 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,507003, ,NINDS,403427,103576, ,Project Summary/Abstract Epilepsy is the 4th most prevalent neurological disorder after stroke Alzheimers and migraine with anincidence of 1 in 26 individuals. Though there are a number of anti-convulsant drugs available there are noanti-epileptogenic drugs that mitigate the progression of the disease. Using novel bioinformatic approacheswe have identified an endogenous protective program launched by the brain after a prolonged seizure thatfunctions to mitigate pathological changes. Epileptogenesis is associated with a plethora of changes in the brain including alterations in plasticitycell death neurogenesis inflammation and axonal sprouting. These changes occur over timescales rangingfrom many minutes to years but the orchestrating mechanisms are virtually unknown. Long-term changes ingene expression that are associated with epileptogenesis imply that one or more master regulators oftranscription may be coordinating the brain alterations. In order to uncover these transcriptional mechanismswe turned to our recently published genome-wide expression datasets generated by the Epilepsy MicroarrayConsortium (EMC). The datasets consist of mRNA expression profiles of rat dentate granule cells assayed atvarious time points after Status Epilepticus (SE). Using a novel bioinformatic tool that integrates wholegenome transcription factor binding data with gene expression profiles we analyzed datasets derived frombrains induced by 3 different convulsant stimuli each in 2 independent labs and at various time-points. Thisanalysis projected that Polycomb target genes represent the majority of chronically altered genes duringepileptogenesis. REST targets represent a second overlapping group of repressed genes. Polycomb is awell-known driver of life-long changes in gene expression that works by epigenetically silencing genes acrossthe phyla. Our data shows an extremely robust induction of EZH2 protein (the catalytic methylase subunit ofPolycomb) over a 20 day window post SE in neurons. Further we find that antagonizing EZH2 shortly afterSE robustly accelerates the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice suggesting a protective ratherthan pathological role for EZH2. How antagonism of EZH2 later after SE remains to be determined. In this project we will test the hypothesis that an alteration in Polycomb output is a principal modifier ofepileptogenesis. We will ascertain whether EZH2 upregulation is always protective or whether its role evolvesduring the latent period. We will test the effect of an order-of-magnitude change in EZH2 levels on corepressorfunction to see whether such upregulation augments or hampers the repressive abilities of two major EZH2containing complexes: Polycomb and REST. We anticipate that these studies will establish Polycomb asa major orchestrator of the long-term changes associated with epileptogenesis. If so approaches thatmodulate Polycomb function may be of benefit to the 65 million people world-wide that live withepilepsy.,507003

Mutations in them cause inherited epilepsy migraine chronic pain and periodicparalysis and they are important molecular targets for drugs. A. New insights into structure and function of Navchannels have come from our high-resolution x-ray crystallography of their bacterial ancestor NavAb. We willfurther define the structural basis for key functional properties of mammalian Nav channels by building theircharacteristic structural features into NavAb including the structural basis for voltage-dependent activation ionselectivity and fast inactivation. Based on these results we will determine the structural basis for impaired Navchannel function by mutations that cause periodic paralysis and the chronic pain syndromes erythromelalgiaand paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. B. Failure of learning and memory is a debilitating aspect of aging andneurodegenerative disease yet we do not understand the basic mechanisms of these crucial brain processesand we cannot intervene effectively in these deficits. Learning and memory takes place primarily at synapses.Presynaptic calcium (Cav2.1) channels initiate neurotransmitter release at most synapses in the brain. Theactivity of these channels is tightly regulated by a large complex of signaling proteins including calmodulin andrelated calcium-sensor proteins. Our work implicates Cav2.1 channel regulation in short-term synaptic plasticityin transfected synapses in cultured neurons and in a novel mouse model in which the IM-AA mutation isinserted into Cav2.1. We will further define the molecular and structural mechanism for Cav2.1 channelregulation determine the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels in short-term synaptic plasticity of neuralcircuits and explore the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels and short-term synaptic plasticity in spatiallearning and memory. Our experiments with this unique mouse model will give unique insights into themechanism of short-term presynaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons and its role in integrative bbrainfunction. C.

Dravet syndrome is caused by mutation in the gene SCN1A which encodes the sodium(Na+) channel Nav1.1 How SCN1A mutation leads to the clinical entity known as Dravet syndromeremains unclear; this gap in knowledge has profoundly limited the practical impact that such a diagnosis hason treatment quality of life and long-term outcome for patients with this disorder.Prior work in experimental animal models of Dravet syndrome including Scn1a+/- mice suggests that loss ofNav1.1 leads to epilepsy via dysfunction of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex with themost prominent identified abnormalities being impaired action potential generation in a critical subtype ofinterneuron known as the parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneuron (PV-IN). However data presented hereindicates that surprisingly PV-IN dysfunction is transient being restricted to a brief time window in earlydevelopment with subsequent recovery of high frequency firing. Preliminary data suggests that the specificlocus of pathology in Dravet syndrome is actually PV-IN axons with abnormal action potential propagationleading to conduction delay and synaptic failure even though PV-INs have recovered the ability to generateaction potentials at high frequency. This finding has important implications for the development of noveltreatment approaches for Dravet syndrome such as cell transplantation gene therapy or precision medicine.This new 5-year application from the lab of an early stage investigator uses innovative neuroscienceapproaches to test this new hypothesis as to the mechanism of pathology in Dravet syndrome. Proposedexperiments will establish the molecular identity and physiological properties of Na+ channels in PV-IN axonsin Scn1a+/- mice as compared to wild-type controls using targeted recordings from interneuron axons anddetailed immunohistochemistry of axonal Na+ channels (Aim 1); determine the impact of PV-IN axonaldysfunction on the timing of feedforward inhibition in cerebral cortical circuits (Aim 2); and assess the activityof defined subsets of neurons in awake behaving Scn1a+/- mice using in vivo imaging and electrophysiologyto corroborate in vitro findings (Aim 3).The overall outcome of the proposed experiments will set forth a unifying hypothesis as to the pathophysiologyof Dravet syndrome. Such knowledge is critical to the development of novel targeted therapies for thiscurrently incurable and untreatable disease. The long-term objective of this line of research is to applypreclinical data from experimental model systems to the development of new mechanistically orientedtherapies in human patients.,438236

Therapy that improves function of defective interneurons is notavailable. Structural development and maintenance of interneurons is dependent on trophic support providedby brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation of TrkB receptors. In the undercut (UC) model ofepileptogenic neocortical injury chronic activation of TrkB-Rs with a selective small molecule partial agonist(LM22A-4 LM below) has long-term effects to reverse structural and functional abnormalities in inhibitoryterminals of PV interneurons enhance GABA release and increase the threshold for evoking epileptiformactivity and seizures. In order to determine whether these effects will be applicable to treatment or preventionof epilepsy in other models with different causes for seizures such as genetic epilepsies the Dravet syndrome(DS) mouse will be used in some experiments. Decreases in a membrane sodium channel in PV interneuronsin DS mice causes decreased release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA and development of spontaneousand high temperature-induced seizures. A variety of experimental approaches in DS and UC mice will be usedto determine whether chronic treatment with LM by increasing GABA release from nerve terminals of SOMand PV interneurons or inducing new inhibitory synapse formation will enhance inhibition in cortical networksand suppress epileptiform discharges: 1) immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging will be used to assessalterations in PV and SOM presynaptic terminals including changes in expression of VGAT- and GAD65/67-IR and the calcium sensor protein synaptotagmin 2; 2) analysis of density of SOM/- and PV/gephyrin closeappositions to test for new inhibitory synapse formation induced by TrkB activation; 3) electrophysiologicalanalysis of basic properties of inhibitory synaptic transmission from PV interneurons to pyramidal neurons of invitro slices to detect effects of TrkB activation on unitary IPSCs release probability and transmission failures;3) laser scanning photostimulation of cortical slices from PV/CHR2 and SOM/CHR2 mice to map thedistribution and strength of inhibitory connectivity in neocortical inhibitory circuits; and 4) video/EEG monitoringof implanted mice to assess effects of treatment with LM on spontaneous seizures and hyperthermia-inducedseizures. Results of these experiments will provide information about mechanisms leading from interneuronalabnormalities to development of epilepsy and a potential approach to prophylaxis of epileptogenesis byenhancing trophic support of interneurons.,76473

Over 1000 loss-of-function mutations in the VGSC SCN1A have been identifiedduring the last two decades and are the main cause of Dravet syndrome (DS) characterized by recurrent early-life febrile seizures (FSs) severe afebrile epilepsy cognitive and behavioral deficits and a 15-20% mortalityrate. Mutations in the VGSC SCN8A were more recently identified in 2012 and already over 200 gain-of-functionSCN8A mutations have been reported in patients with a range of clinical features including catastrophictreatment-resistant childhood epilepsy autism intellectual disability and developmental delay. Unfortunatelymost anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) fail to adequately treat the broad range of severe seizures and behavioralphenotypes in patients with SCN1A- and SCN8A-derived epilepsy. Thus despite recent progress inpharmacological treatments for DS there remains a need to develop more effective longer lasting treatmentswith fewer side effects. Neuropeptides are well known in animal studies to show great promise for controllingseizures and ameliorating behavioral abnormalities; however they do not readily cross the blood brain barrierand are rapidly metabolized when given systemically. Thus poor brain penetrance is a critical barrier to theclinical application of these promising therapeutics. To overcome this challenge we developed and validated anapproach based on the encapsulation of neuropeptides in nanoparticles conjugated to rabies virus glycoprotein(RVG). Using this approach we have found that intranasal delivery of nanoparticle-encapsulated oxytocin (NP-OT) greatly increases brain penetrance and the capacity of OT to confer robust and sustained increases inresistance to seizures in mouse models of SCN1A and SCN8A dysfunction. We have also extended our strategyto encapsulate neuropeptide Y (NP-NPY) and similarly observed a robust improvement in its ability to conferseizure resistance. In the proposed study we will establish the ability of NP-OT and NP-NPY to amelioratespontaneous seizures and behavioral abnormalities in Scn1a and Scn8a mouse mutants (Aim 1). While the roleof OT in social behavior is well-studied less is known about the mechanisms by which it modulates seizuresusceptibility. Thus we will also identify the cellular and neural circuit mechanisms that contribute to the abilityof OT to increase seizure resistance in the Scn1a and Scn8a mutants (Aim 2). Our long-term goal is to developsafe and effective approaches for the brain delivery of neuropeptides for the treatment of epilepsy and otherneurological disorders.,472869

Neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability and autism are oftencomorbid with seizure disorders such as epilepsy. Mutations in a number of genes have recently been discoveredwhich cause neurodevelopmental disorders comorbid with epilepsy suggesting common etiological mechanisms.Among these genes encoding neuronal adhesion molecules are very highly represented. Here we propose tocontinue to investigate novel neuronal functions of a prominent representative of this family CNTNAP2 mutations inwhich cause monogenic syndromes of intellectual disability autism and language disorder comorbid with epilepsy.Specifically we will investigate the neurodevelopmental functions of CNTNAP2 ectodomain shedding (cleavage andrelease of the extracellular domain) in paracrine signaling. Based on our findings from the previous funding periodwe hypothesize that specific regions on CNTNAP2's ectodomain can modulate network properties and seizureactivity in the intact mouse brain; CNTNAP2-ecto shedding is dysregulated in human subjects with and mouse modelsof neurodevelopmental seizure disorders. We will test this hypothesis by combining expertise in molecularneurobiology epilepsy proteomics and pharmacology using animal models and human clinical CSF samples andby employing several cutting-edge methodologies in the following Specific Aims: 1) To map the structuraldeterminants of CNTNAP2-ecto function. 2) To characterize the impact of CNTNAP2-ecto on network and seizureactivity in mice. 3) To explore the relationship between shed ectodomains detected in the CSF and seizure activity.On a basic level data generated will provide new insights into the biology of paracrine signaling by neuronalectodomain shedding and reveal novel mechanisms of regulation neuronal network activity during brain development.In the long run our studies will provide novel insight into the molecular basis of alterations in both epilepsy andneurodevelopmental disorders and have the potential to provide preclinical proof-of-principle for novel therapeuticstrategies for interventions in developmental seizure disorders.,544893

The risk of sudden death is 24times greater in epilepsy patients than the general population and sudden unexplained death inepilepsy (SUDEP) ranks 2nd highest among neurologic diseases in potential years of life lost. Thereare currently no preventative treatments for this devastating epilepsy sequelae. Therefore researchinto mechanisms for prevention of SUDEP is critically important as indicated in the NINDSbenchmarks. Death in most witnessed SUDEP cases results from generalized tonic-clonic seizures(GTCS) leading to terminal apnea. We have developed the DBA/1 mouse model of SUDEP whichmimics human SUDEP in that it exhibits GTCS and seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) thatleads directly to death. Several other labs have recently utilized this model. Research in DBA/1 miceled to the development of the serotonin theory of SUDEP which has received positive support inrecent studies in epilepsy patients. This hypothesis first proposed by our lab is based in part on thefindings that treatments which enhance the action of serotonin block seizure-induced death. TheSUDEP models in which the hypothesis has been tested include the Dravet mice which modelDravet syndrome an intractable form of human epilepsy that has a high risk for SUDEP. Dravet miceare genetically modified to mimic human Dravet syndrome and also show sudden death due to S-IRA. Dravet mice exhibit heat-induced seizures and death can be prevented by timely resuscitationsimilar to DBA/1 mice. Importantly in epilepsy patients non-fatal but significant respiratory deficitsfrequently occur after GTCS and postictal apnea is the most common cause of human SUDEP. Thisproposal will utilize DBA/1 and Dravet mice to test preventative measures for SUDEP. Our recentneuroimaging studies in DBA/1 mice have provided suggestive evidence that a specific brainstemsite- the periaqueductal gray (PAG)-may be critical in preventing seizure-induced death. The PAG isknown to play a critical role to compensate for many types of non-epilepsy-related respiratory deficits.PAG stimulation is currently used in patients to treat chronic pain and will enhance respiration. Wehave preliminarily evaluated the effects of PAG stimulation and found that it enhances respiration inanesthetized DBA/1 mice. Therefore we will explore if PAG electrical stimulation will enhancerespiration and reverse S-IRA following seizures induced in behaving DBA/1 and Dravet mice.Aim 1: To explore if timely electrical stimulation of the PAG can prevent audiogenic seizure-inducedrespiratory arrest (S-IRA) and death in the DBA/1 mouse model of SUDEP.Aim 2: To examine if timely PAG electrical stimulation can prevent seizure-induced sudden death inthe Dravet mouse model of SUDEP induced by elevated temperature.,184375

Synaptic integration and plasticity are the cellular mechanisms of information pro-cessing learning and memory. How these fundamental processes are disrupted in epilepsy is not understood.Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus/Dravet syndrome (GEFS+/DS) is a spectrum of epilepsy disor-ders linked to mutations of the SCN1B gene which cause seizures neurodevelopmental delays and early death.To develop treatments for seizures/cognitive deficits of GEFS+/DS epilepsies there is a critical need to identifymechanisms by which SCN1B mutations disrupt cellular-level information processing and learning. Our long-term goal is to define general principles linking genes to disrupted synaptic integration and plasticity in suchneurodevelopmental disorders. The overall objective of our proposal is to define how the interplay between syn-apses dendritic physiology and somatic physiology impair synaptic integration and plasticity in the Scn1b knock-out (KO) mouse model of GEFS+/DS. Our central hypothesis is loss of Scn1b dysregulates ion channels anddendrite excitability disturbing integration and plasticity. To test this hypothesis we will complete three Aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms of somatic and dendritic hyperexcitability in Scn1b KO neurons.Based on preliminary data our hypothesis is that both dendrites and somata of Scn1b KO CA1 pyramidal neu-rons exhibit intrinsic hyperexcitability in part due to abnormal HCN channel activity. We will test this hypothesiswith whole cell somatic and dendritic recordings immunohistochemistry and cell morphology analyses. Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms of altered synaptic integration in Scn1b KO neurons. Based on ourpreliminary data our hypothesis is that loss of Scn1b fundamentally alters the translation of inputs into outputswith both temporal and spatial synaptic integration abnormally enhanced due to dendritic hyperexcitability anddisrupted synaptic physiology. We will use whole cell recordings to test how temporal and spatial features ofinput/output functions are altered in Scn1b KO neurons in response to naturalistic patterns of synaptic inputs. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that Scn1b disruption alters synaptic learning rules and gating by GABAthat dictate plasticity. Based on our preliminary data our hypothesis is that synaptic learning rules governingLTP and LTD induction are re-shaped due to interplay between suppressed excitation hyperexcitable intrinsicproperties and abnormal gating by aberrant depolarizing inhibition after loss of Scn1b. We will test how inputpatterns that evoke LTP and LTD shift after loss of Scn1b and how inhibition influences this plasticity.

SUDEPmechanisms are not understood although there is evidence to implicate apnea autonomic dysfunction andcardiac arrhythmias. Our work in mice led to the hypothesis that cardiac arrhythmias contribute to the mechanismof SUDEP in channelopathy-linked genetic epilepsies. We demonstrated altered cardiac myocyte (CM) ioniccurrents calcium handling and action potentials (APs) as well as cardiac arrhythmias in mouse models ofSCN1A- SCN8A- and SCN1B-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). We showed thatinduced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived CMs from Dravet syndrome (DS) patients have substrates forarrhythmias. Importantly no animal or iPSC model can completely replicate the human DS phenotype. Becausemouse and human cardiac APs are very different we used human iPSC-CM models to investigate cellautonomous effects of SCN1A haploinsufficiency. However cells in 2-dimensional culture cannot replicatecomplex cardiac tissues cardiovascular changes or cardiac innervation. Here we will develop and validate alarge animal model in which the role of cardiac arrhythmias in addition to seizures in SUDEP can beinvestigated. Rabbits closely replicate the human cardiac AP and provide a complete organism to translate tothe clinical setting. Our objective is to develop and validate a transgenic rabbit model of SCN1A-linked DS. Wegenerated a New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit Scn1a deletion model using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.However NZW Scn1a+/- rabbits showed neither seizures nor cardiac arrhythmia. We later found that F1: NZW xDutch Belted Scn1a+/- rabbits have seizures cardiac arrhythmia and premature death. These exciting resultssuggest that we may have generated the first transgenic large animal model of a DEE although this model mustnow be rigorously validated. If validated this work will be a significant advance over currently available DSmodels. R61 Phase Specific Aims: 1. To characterize seizure onset seizure types seizure frequency andduration and determine the rate of SUDEP in DS rabbits. 2. To characterize arrhythmia types frequency andduration whether arrhythmias occur independently of seizures and whether cardiac arrhythmia is associatedwith SUDEP in DS rabbits. R33 Phase Specific Aim: To validate the model using the ASO drug STK-001 or thedrug combination stiripentol + clobazam to reduce seizures and SUDEP. Establishing a genetic rabbit model ofDS will better inform the translatability of neuro-cardiac mechanisms of SUDEP to human disease.,372094

Seizures may impair arousal to important stimuli such asCO2 to contribute to SUDEP.

SUDEP is second only to stroke in years of potential life lost to neurological disease and is amajor public health problem. Several etiologies have been proposed for SUDEP including cardiac andrespiratory dysregulation. Another that is postulated is impaired arousal. Seizures impair arousal. Amongarousal stimuli one that may be particularly relevant to SUDEP is CO2. CO2 rises following seizures andis part of the seizure cessation mechanism. Seizures are frequently associated with ictal and post-ictalcentral and obstructive apneas. Apnea further exacerbates the accumulation of CO2. Impairment of CO2-arousal is proposed as an etiological factor in another sudden death entity sudden infant deathsyndrome which has many parallels with SUDEP. We discovered that seizures impaired CO2-arousal inseizure nave mice and those that do not have a particularly profound death rate. Whether this is true inmouse models with strong SUDEP phenotypes is unknown. Thus our goal in this proposal is to determinehow seizures in different sleep states impair CO2-arousal in mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy(TLE) and the genetic epileptic encephalopathy Dravet Syndrome (DS). In Aim 1 we will determine theextent to which CO2-arousal is impaired in epilepsy models. We will focus on the pilocarpine-TLE modelas many patients that die of SUDEP have TLE and the DS model as patients with DS have adisproportionately high SUDEP risk. We will also determine whether simply having epilepsy in thesemodels impairs CO2-arousal as a potential easily measurable biomarker for SUDEP risk. In Aim 2 we willdetermine whether neuronal function assessed via fiber photometry of arousal system components inthe dorsal raphe nucleus and parabrachial nucleus two important contributors to sleep-wake regulationand key nodes in CO2-arousal is impaired by seizures and epilepsy. In Aim 3 we will determine whetheroptogenetically stimulating a DRN-PBN circuit in DS mice using a novel mouse model prior to seizuresprevents seizure-induced death lending direct insights into possible therapeutic measures. Since themodels employed have known death rates we will be able to compare findings between mice that dieand those that survive making these studies more relevant to SUDEP. Combining these findings with ourprevious work we will have a powerful rigorous translatable approach to identify convergent anddivergent mechanisms across models for how impaired CO2-arousal in epilepsy contributes to SUDEPrisk. We expect to be able to leverage these mechanisms to identify at-risk individuals and reduce deathfrom this devastating disease.,553509

Most concerning are the severe seizures and high risk of suddenunexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Mutations in voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC)  and  subunitgenes are linked to DS. While the majority of DS cases are linked to SCN1A haploinsufficiency SCN1Bhomozygous mutations are also linked to DS. Scn1b-/- mice have a DS phenotype with SUDEP. SCN1Bencodes VGSC 1 subunits which are developmentally regulated cell adhesion molecules and ion channelmodulators that play critical roles in the regulation of excitability. Scn1b-/- mice have cell type specific changesin Na+ (INa) and K+ (IK) currents. In addition Scn1b-/- mice have neuronal proliferation migration andpathfinding defects at postnatal day (P)5 that precede seizure onset at ~P10. These data suggested thatalterations in CAM function may contribute to hyperexcitability however new data challenge this idea and offerthe alternative explanation that defective cell adhesion in SCN1B-linked DS may not contribute to seizures butinstead impact other co-morbidities. Preliminary data show that Scn1b-/- mice also have delayed maturation ofneuronal Cl- gradients such that GABAergic signaling remains depolarizing and excitatory until ~P17-18 whichmay contribute to hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The objective of this work is to understand themechanism of hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The central hypothesis is that the mechanism ofhyperexcitability in the Scn1b-/- model of DS is cell type specific changes in INa IK and GABAergic signaling.Further it is proposed that human SCN1B-DS mutations result in loss-of-function with similar defects in ioniccurrents and delayed maturation of GABAergic signaling as observed in Scn1b-/- neurons. The experimentalplan will test three Aims: 1. To determine the mechanism of hyperexcitability resulting from Scn1b deletion; 2.To determine whether human SCN1B-linked DS mutations result in loss-of-function in mouse models; 3. Todetermine the phenotype of SCN1B-linked DS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons.Model choice is key to understanding epilepsy mechanisms. Importantly mice are not small humans. Thuspatient-derived iPSC neuronal models provide essential information regarding human disease. On the otherhand mature brain networks cannot yet be replicated using iPSCs and so brain slice preparations fromtransgenic mouse models remain important to understanding circuitry. Rather than relying on a single modelthis project will compare and contrast human and mouse models to understand key mechanistic aspects of thedevelopment of hyperexcitability in DS. Even though SCN1B-linked DS is rare compared to SCN1A-linkeddisease this work may lead to the discovery of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in DS caused bymultiple types of gene mutations.,716609

Our recent investigation of zebrafish mutants featuring a loss-of-function sodium channel (scn1a)mutation (e.g. a gene mutation identified in ~80% of DS patients) focused on drug discovery anddevelopment metabolic dysfunction and behavioral comorbidities. Using a high-throughput phenotype-basedscreening strategy and medicinal chemistry we screened nearly 3000 drugs successfully identified aserotonin (5HT) receptor mechanism underlying anti-seizure activity of clemizole and developed three novelclemizole analogs. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology we generated new zebrafish mutant linesfor chd2 gabrb3 pcdh19 and stxbp1 (e.g. de novo mutations seen in ~20% of DS patients). Interestinglystxbp1 and gabrb3 mutants exhibit epileptic phenotypes. We also designed and manufactured a microfluidicmulti-channel electrode-integrated platform for long-term non-invasive electrophysiology on larval zebrafish(Hong et al. 2016) and developed a calcium imaging-analysis pipeline for studying seizure macro- and micro-networks in vivo (Liu and Baraban 2019). The proposed work will leverage these unique tools. Three specificaims are proposed: (i) to resolve neural networks responsible for seizures in larval DS zebrafish (ii) to performhigh-throughput drug screening using zebrafish and (iii) to further evaluate clemizole and related anti-seizurecompounds. Techniques will include automated locomotion tracking in vivo zebrafish electrophysiologypharmacology and fast calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium- and voltage-sensitive indicators.Our results promise to simultaneously advance our long-term goals (i) to better understand thepathophysiology of genetic epilepsies and (ii) identify promising new treatment options for these intractableconditions.,510261

Mutations in SCN1Aencoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 are the most common genetic cause of epilepsy.Over 1600 SCN1A mutations have been reported in individuals with epilepsy of varying severity ranging frommild febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome a severe infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy caused byheterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Dravet syndrome is characterized by a variety of seizure typesdevelopmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variableexpressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by geneticmodifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) recapitulate core features of Dravet syndromephenotypes including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reducedsodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons resulting in failure of inhibition and excitatory/inhibitoryimbalance in the brain. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is strongly dependent on strain background. Scn1a+/-mice on the resistant 129 strain (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrastScn1a+/- mice on a [129xB6]F1 strain (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality with50% dying by 1 month of age. Strain-dependent differences are also evident at the level of neuron subtypes.GABAergic interneurons isolated from the susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased sodium current densitycompared to wildtype littermates while sodium current density is preserved in interneurons isolated from129.Scn1a+/- relative to wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for theloss of Nav1.1 while F1 interneurons do not. Based on the strain-dependent difference in phenotypes at thewhole animal and cellular levels we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severitydue to differences in compensatory capacity among neuronal subtypes in the context of Scn1a heterozygousdeletion. We previously mapped several Dravet survival modifier (Dsm) loci that influence premature lethality ofScn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal we will address our hypothesis in three aims. First we will perform finemapping and candidate gene analysis at two Dsm loci on mouse chromosomes 7 and 8. Second we will performsingle cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize differences in cell composition and gene expression in specific cellsubpopulations during the critical phase of phenotype onset in epilepsy susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant129.Scn1a+/- mice. Third we will evaluate the modifier potential of candidate genes in vivo using transcriptionalmodulation to up- and down-regulate candidate gene expression. Results from these studies will identify modifiergenes and pathways that influence phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Identification of modifier genes thatinfluence severity of Dravet syndrome will provide insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and will suggestnovel therapeutic approaches for improved treatment of human patients.,493135

Respiratoryfailure is a leading cause of SUDEP and DS patients' frequently exhibit disordered breathing.However mechanisms underlying respiratory dysfunction in DS are unknown. Evidencesuggests cortical seizures activate inhibitory projections to suppress brainstem function andresult in death; however a yet unexplored possibility is that DS-associated mutations directlyaffect brainstem respiratory centers and serve as a common substrate for both seizure andrespiratory dysfunction. We recently showed that Scn1a transcript is highly expressed inbrainstem inhibitory neurons and expression of a DS-associated Scn1a mutation (A1783V) ininhibitory neurons resulted in cell autonomous loss of neural activity and disruption ofrespiratory function at the cellular and whole-animal levels. Therefore I hypothesize that loss ofScn1a function directly impacts brainstem respiratory control. To test this I will disrupt Scn1afunction globally (Scn1a-/+) specifically in all VGAT+ inhibitory neurons and only in glycinergicneurons (GlyT2:A1783V) and determine whether these animals exhibit disordered breathingseizures or premature death (Aim 1) and altered cellular activity of respiratory neurons (Aim 2).This work will provide novel insight into roles of glycinergic neurons in DS and determine theextent to which loss of Scn1a function directly affect brainstem function.,44681

Clinical and animal studies show that seizure-induced respiratoryarrest is the primary event leading to death. Increased serotonin (5-HT) levels in the brain reduce seizure-induced respiratory arrest in provoked seizure models. However it is unclear whether enhancing 5-HT neuro-transmission exerts protective effects on seizure-induced sudden death in spontaneous seizure (epilepsy)models and which 5-HT circuitry is involved in this sudden death in both provoked and spontaneous seizuremodels. These gaps in knowledge have significantly hindered the therapeutics to prevent SUDEP in patients.The long-term goal is to foster effective prevention strategies against SUDEP using approaches targeted tospecific SUDEP mechanisms. The overall objectives of this proposal are to (1) determine the efficacy of 5-HT-enhancing agents in suppressing seizure-induced sudden death and (2) elucidate the involved 5-HT circuitrymechanisms in animal models especially in a widely-used mouse model of human Dravet syndrome (a type ofepilepsy) that displays spontaneous seizures with a high rate of seizure-induced sudden death. The centralhypothesis is that enhanced 5-HT signaling prevents seizure-induced sudden death and that the 5-HT raphe-amygdala circuitry is involved in this sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. The rationale for this proposal isthat a determination of preclinical therapeutic efficacy of 5-HT-enhancing agents and 5-HT neuronal circuitrymechanisms in seizure-induced sudden death is likely to offer a strong scientific framework by which newstrategies against human SUDEP can be developed. The central hypothesis will be tested in the following twospecific aims: 1) Determine the protective effects of enhancing 5-HT neurotransmission on seizure-inducedsudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice; and 2) Elucidate how 5-HT circuitry from raphe nuclei to the amygda-la modifies seizure-induced sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. We will employ a combination of simul-taneous video EEG/ECG/plethysmography monitoring electrophysiology pharmacology and cell-type specifictechnologies (optogenetics and DREADDs) to perform the work in these aims. The proposed research is inno-vative because it defines a novel 5-HT circuitry mechanism of seizure-induced sudden death using optogenet-ics and DREADDs in animal models especially in a human disease model which could conceptually advancethe knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms of SUDEP. The proposed work is significant becausethe expected outcomes will potentially foster targeted pharmacologic and neurostimulatory interventions ofSUDEP to save lives of at-risk patients.,374922

Dravet syndrome (DS) which results from a loss of function of the sodium channel (NaV)isoform NaV1.1 is associated with a particularly high risk of SUDEP. Notably the unexpected mortality of SUDEPmirrors cases of sudden cardiac death (SCD)  unexpected death resulting from cardiac arrhythmias. Emergingevidence points to physiological commonalities between the brain and the heart suggesting that the verymolecular mechanisms that underlie epileptic disorders could also directly impact the heart leading to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and thereby SCD. However the precise mechanisms by which DS directlyimpact the heart to promote cardiac arrhythmias and SCD remain unknown. Thus we propose to utilize modelsof DS to address this gap in knowledge and to explore the role of direct cardiac remodeling in SCD. Using thesemodels we will test the hypothesis that defects in NaVs that underlie inherited epileptic disorders such as Dravetsyndrome dysregulate cardiac Na+/Ca2+ cycling thereby promoting life-threatening arrhythmias and contributingto SCD. Thus we propose to: 1) Define the phenotypic and structural impacts of tissue-specific expression ofDS-associated defects. 2) Determine the functional impact of DS-associated Na+/Ca2+ signaling nanodomainremodeling on cardiac Ca2+ handling. 3) Assess efficacy of targeting Na+/Ca2+ signaling nanodomains for SCDprevention. Information gleaned from these studies will be used to develop new therapeutic approaches to treatSCD in DS.,424758

The majority of NDD-associated SNVs affect a single allele of a geneleading to haploinsufficiency. Correcting haploinsufficiency by increasing the expression level of the deficientallele could provide an attractive strategy for NDDs treatment. A variant of CRISPR CRISPRa (CRISPRactivation) offers the possibility to modulate the expression of endogenous genes by directly targeting theirpromoters or enhancers. Here we are proposing to apply CRISPRa to upregulate the levels of Cul3 ubiquitinligase a high-confidence gene for NDDs. We have recently generated a haploinsufficient Cul3 mouse model.Brain MRI found decreased volume of cortical regions starting from early postnatal development and persistinginto adulthood. Spatiotemporal transcriptomic and proteomic profiling implicated cytoskeletal and synapticdefects as key drivers of Cul3 functional impact. Specifically dendritic growth filamentous actin puncta andspontaneous network activity measured by multielectrode arrays (MEA) were reduced in Cul3 mutant mice. Cul3mutant mice also exhibited hyperactive behavior along with social and cognitive deficits. We hypothesize thatupregulation of Cul3 dosage early in development with CRSIPRa will rescue some (or all) of the observedphenotypes and will lay the basis for general therapeutic interventions in NDDs. The goal of this projectis to demonstrate the feasibility of compensating for Cul3 haploinsufficiency by rebalancing neuronal molecularcellular and network activity phenotypes. We will achieve this goal through the following Specific Aims: (1) Toevaluate rescue potential of cellular and molecular phenotypes in the Cul3+/- CRISPRa mice; (2) To evaluaterescue potential of brain architecture and cognitive deficits in Cul3+/- CRISPRa mice. Our study will represent aneffective strategy for rebalancing Cul3 (and potentially other NDD genes) deficiency and correcting associatedphenotypes.,237000

This is a serious medicalproblem because patients with severe progressive forms of drug-resistant epilepsy have a high risk of suddenunexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Thus the need for novel and effective strategies for the preventionand treatment of epilepsy is pressing. Among the potential adjunctive therapies for such refractory forms ofepilepsy diet-based approaches hold great promise as they are often economical and associated with few ad-verse side effects. Our long-term goal is to provide the scientific foundation necessary for developing neweffective interventions for combating drug-resistant epilepsy. To this end it will be necessary to elucidate themolecular and cellular mechanisms through which dietary modifications reduce seizures and SUDEP. Theoverall objectives of this exploratory project are to determine 1) the beneficial effects of dietarysupplementation with -linolenic acid (ALA) an essential -3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) on mousemodels of epilepsy and 2) how therapeutic diets affect the morphology and physiological function of brainneurons that are relevant to epilepsy. Our central hypothesis is that orally administered ALA and milk wheyreduce phenotypic severity in mouse models of epilepsy by inducing morphological and physiological changesin brain GABAergic neurons. This hypothesis is based in part on our preliminary findings in fruit flies andmice: 1) supplementation of diets with milk whey significantly suppresses neuronal and behavioralhyperexcitability in Drosophila as well as spontaneous seizures and SUDEP in epileptic mice and 2) ALA inmilk whey mediates this diet-induced suppression of seizures in Drosophila. The current project will use mousevoltage-gated sodium channel mutants well-established models of human epilepsy. Aim #1 is to determine theeffects of ALA on SUDEP and seizures. Mice that model Dravet syndrome (Scn1aR1407X/+) and early infantileepileptic encephalopathy (Scn8aN1768D/+) will be fed ALA daily after weaning and spontaneous seizures andSUDEP will be monitored under continuous video surveillance. Hyperthermia-induced seizures will also bescored for frequency and severity in the presence or absence of ALA feeding. Aim #2 is to delineate diet-induced morphological and physiological alterations in brain neurons. The effects of milk whey and ALA on themorphology of neocortical GABAergic interneurons will be assessed by examining their numbers dendriticcomplexity axonal projections and terminal density in Scn1aR1407X/+ mutants. The effects of therapeutic dietson the function of GABAergic neurons will also be determined by patch clamp recordings from neocorticalslices. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify the beneficial effects of dietarymodifications on mouse models of genetic epilepsy under well-controlled conditions as well as the changes inbrain neurons that are induced by diet. These outcomes represent a solid foundation for future studies of themolecular and cellular mechanisms by which modified diets protect against epilepsy.,424875

A growing proportion of pediatric epilepsies are tied to causative variants in ion channel genes includingthe voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN2A. The 2020 Epilepsy Research Benchmarks of NINDS prioritizeidentifying how genetic variants cause epilepsy and related neurodevelopmental disorders. SCN2A variants thatmanifest with loss-of-function are associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders and late-onset epilepsy.On the other hand gain-of-function SCN2A variants predominantly have a phenotype of early-onset epilepsy.The encoded sodium channel (NaV1.2) is highly expressed in excitatory glutamatergic neurons early indevelopment presenting a unique opportunity to examine how excitatory neuron dysfunction leads to early-onsetepilepsy. Animal and human tissue-derived neuron models have brought mechanistic insight to how Dravetsyndrome results in interneuron dysfunction and epilepsy. Among SCN2A-related diseases animal modelsilluminate how loss-of-function leads to autism spectrum disorder with late-onset epilepsy. Due to lack of readilyavailable disease models there is sparse mechanistic understanding of how excitatory neuron dysfunction earlyin development leads to early-onset epilepsy. This proposal will exploit two early-onset epilepsy variants ofSCN2A that have a convergent clinical phenotype yet divergent biophysical mechanisms. Patient-derived neuronmodels and mouse models provide the opportunity to define the point of mechanistic convergence at multiplescales: from single neurons to neural circuits influencing epilepsy phenotype. Aim 1 will determine how two gain-of-function SCN2A variants encoding missense mutations M1879T and E430A confer increased excitability bydistinct mechanisms. Functional analysis of iPSC-derived neurons in isolation and in elementary circuits willdefine how the different variants impact excitability and thus converge toward an epileptic phenotype. Aim 2 willdefine hippocampal higher-level circuit perturbations in epileptic mice designed with genome editing torecapitulate the SCN2A-E430A human epileptic encephalopathy. Ex vivo analysis of changes in excitabilitysynaptic signaling and network output in the hippocampus will lead to new understanding of how gain-of-functionSCN2A variants affect neuronal networks.

Along with an increase inopioid use disorders a rise in opioid-related overdose deaths has occurred in the last decade.Chronic pain and opioid abuse are more prevalent than before constituting a public health crisisand exacting a heavy toll on patients caregivers physicians and society. There is a currenttherapeutic challenge for managing opioid use opioid withdrawal symptoms chronic pain and/orassociated anxiety and depression. A severe need remains for alternative and safe therapeuticregimens that properly treat these conditions. We propose to develop a cannabinoid-opioidcombination with opioid-sparing and synergistic analgesic effects to prevent opioid use disorderand overdose addressing the current national opioid epidemic. BDH Pharma LLC completed aproof-of-concept preclinical study of a fixed dose cannabinoid-opioid combination thatdemonstrated opioid-sparing and synergistic analgesic effects with the combination providinggreater analgesia in a rodent model of chronic pain than a standard dose of the opioid alone.Building on that data our SBIR Phase I grant supported a preclinical pharmacokinetic drug-druginteraction and safety study to determine if co-administration altered the pharmacokinetics and/orrespiratory depression related to either compound in rodents. Study results indicated PKparameters remained unaltered except for a decrease in half-life for the opioid. When measuringrespiratory depression we found that the presence of the cannabinoid was able to attenuaterespiratory depression induced by the opioid. Taken together study results have shown that ourlead candidate BDH-001 exhibits synergistic and opioid-sparing analgesic effects and does notdisplay significant drug-drug interactions nor has any deleterious effects on respiratorydepression. This suggests that BDH-001 may have improved analgesia with lower opioid dosesand thereby lower the risk of dependence withdrawal diversion abuse and overdose. Thisproposal will continue the development of BDH-001 by completing pre-formulation andformulation studies to support co-formulation of our FDC for sublingual administration and providerequired data for IND submission. These studies will support the selection of prototypes for short-term stability testing before the clinical supply manufacturing under GMP conditions and long-term stability testing. Upon completion of the proposed Phase II aims and subsequent INDsubmission BDH-001 will be ready for the clinical phase of development with an initial indicationof chronic low back pain.,1136636

The proposed work investigates the role of NaV1.1 inthe transmission of gustatory signals with particular regard to its role in mediating sweet taste.

RNA-seq transcriptomic data shows that NaV1.1 is expressed insubsets of ganglion cells thought to transmit particular taste qualities including sweet. My preliminarybehavioral and electrophysiological studies also suggest that NaV1.1 may mediate sweet taste signaltransmission both in an acute i.e. pharmacological block mouse model as well as in a genetic model of NaV1.1haploinsufficiency. In this proposal three different mouse models  one acute and two genetic  will beassessed on peripheral gustatory deficits (Aim 1) and behavioral effects (Aim 2) due to Nav1.1 dysfunction. Thisstudy is innovative because our preliminary data suggest that 1) a single type of sodium channel maydifferentially impact transmission of particular taste qualities and 2) gustatory function may serve as asurrogate measure for NaV1.1 function. The latter would be particularly useful for assessing phenotype severityin Dravet patients which as of yet does not have a robust biomarker to use in assessment.,34519

Our proposal aims to remedythis by engineering novel AAV capsids to allow enhanced neuronal transduction of primate brain developing asuite of optimized AAV vectors for more precise cell type and cell class-selective delivery of transgenes andtesting if virus-mediated restoration of sodium channel function in forebrain inhibitory neurons can correct thedevastating neurological deficits of Dravet syndrome.,NIMH,10462660,7/11/2022 0:00,RFA-MH-19-135,5UG3MH120095-03,5,UG3,MH,120095,3, ,"KIM, DOUGLAS S",9/1/2020 0:00,2/29/2024 0:00,ZMH1-ERB-Q(03), ,8084887,"TING, JONATHAN T","KALUME, FRANCK K; LEIN, ED ; LEVI, BOAZ PIRIE",7,Unavailable,137210949,NFHEUCKBFMU4,137210949,NFHEUCKBFMU4,US,47.650084,-122.351604,10012306,ALLEN INSTITUTE,SEATTLE,WA,Research Institutes,981094307,UNITED STATES,N,7/1/2022 0:00,2/29/2024 0:00,242,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,1337597, ,NIMH,1200045,362293, ,Abstract:Many cell types together assemble the functional circuitry of the human brain. For over a century neuroscientistshave categorized brain cell types by their features including shape position physiology molecules andfunction. Single cell transcriptomics studies are now defining molecular cell types at a resolution not previouslypossible uncovering a taxonomy of hundreds to thousands of brain cell types. These studies have also revealeddramatic differences in molecular signatures of homologous cell types across species showing decisively thatthe difference between mouse and human brain is not simply the total number of neurons. However the functionof each cell class or type in brain circuitry and dysfunction in disease is only beginning to be evaluated. Tocharacterize the roles of human brain cell classes in normal function and disease it is critical that tools bedeveloped to allow genetic access to cell classes in vivo. Such tools would enable precise therapeutic genedelivery to brain cell classes permitting targeted treatment for class-specific etiologies like some epilepsies.Few genetic tools are available to mark and manipulate cell classes and types in non-genetically tractablespecies like human and non-human primate (NHP). Viruses including adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)containing cell class and type selective enhancers can be leveraged to gain genetic access to and drive geneexpression in specific brain cell classes in these species. We have initiated a project through the BRAIN Initiativeto generate and validate reporter AAVs to mark specific cell classes in the mouse cortex in vivo and in humanneocortical tissue ex vivo. Our groups have engineered AAV vectors and optimized capsids to access neuronsand express transgenes in many discrete cell classes and types in mouse and primate. New and improved AAVtools promise to fuel human brain scientific discovery and clinical progress but one impediment has been thecostly and time-consuming process of validating new vectors in primates.We present three Aims to translate these promising new AAV vectors into a high-value set of primate-optimizedtools that could eventually be used for gene therapies in humans. First we will develop a platform for screeningAAV vectors in NHP ex vivo brain slices followed by individual validation of promising vectors in NHP in vivoand human ex vivo brain slice cultures. Second we will identify optimal AAV capsids to: a) support widespreadNHP neuronal transduction in vivo when applied intravenously or to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) two preferredroutes of delivery for human CNS gene therapy and b) support AAV transduction of human primary brain tissueex vivo. Third we will perform proof-of-concept experiments using cell class-selective vectors to express atherapeutic transgene in defined classes to treat a severe and intractable form of childhood epilepsy calledDravet syndrome (DS). These experiments represent a significant step towards converting cell class-selectiveAAVs into first-in-class viral tools optimized for in vivo NHP brain studies and human gene therapy applications.,1337597

SUDEPmechanisms are not understood although there is evidence to implicate apnea autonomic dysfunction andcardiac arrhythmias. We will take advantage of recent progress in the understanding of SUDEP risk in the geneticepilepsies to investigate the role of cardiac arrhythmias. SUDEP risk varies in a gene-specific manner. Loss-of-function variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) genes SCN1A or SCN1B are identified inpatients with Dravet syndrome (DS) and gain-of-function variants in the VGSC SCN8A are found in patients withEarly Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 13 (EIEE13). DS and EIEE13 patients have the highest SUDEP risk upto 20%. In contrast variants in chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) are also associated withearly onset EE but SUDEP has not been reported in this population. SCN1A- SCN1B- SCN8A- and CHD2-linked epilepsies are developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) severe childhood epilepsiesassociated with cognitive and behavioral impairments. The familial focal epilepsies are attributed to pathogenicvariants in DEPDC5 encoding a member of the GATOR complex in the mTOR pathway. SUDEP is reported in10% of these patients. Because VGSC genes are expressed in both heart and brain we have proposed thatcardiac arrhythmias contribute to the mechanism of SUDEP in channelopathy-linked genetic epilepsies. Ouroverall goal is to understand the mechanisms of SUDEP in the genetic epilepsies. Our objectives are to usepatient-derived or transgenic mouse cardiac myocytes (CMs) to understand how epileptic VGSC gene mutationsalter CM function and arrhythmogenic potential and to determine whether similar changes are found in non-ionchannel epilepsy genes that are expressed in the heart. Our central hypothesis is that both ion channel and non-ion channel genetic epilepsies with high but not low SUDEP risk exhibit pro-arrhythmogenic changes in patient-derived CMs and mouse models. To ask whether abnormal CM excitability also occurs in a non-ion channelgenetic epilepsy with high SUDEP risk we will investigate DEPDC5 variant iPSC-CMs and Depdc5-/- mice.Finally we will examine Chd2-/- mice and human iPSC-CMs with variants in CHD2 a non-ion channel gene witha low SUDEP risk to test whether altered CM excitability is specific to genetic epilepsies with high SUDEP rates.Like the VGSCs DEPDC5 and CHD2 are expressed in brain and heart. Our Specific Aims are: 1. To determinethe effects of SCN1A SCN1B and SCN8A epilepsy variants on CM excitability using patient-derived iPSC-CMs.2. To ascertain whether CMs from DEPDC5 patients or Depdc5+/- mice display abnormal excitability and whetherDepdc5+/- mice have arrhythmia. 3. To determine whether CMs from CHD2 patients or Chd2+/- mice displayabnormal excitability and whether Chd2+/- mice have arrhythmia. There are no effective therapies for any of thegenetic epilepsies and no reliable biomarkers for SUDEP risk. This work may lead to the discovery of diagnosticbiomarkers for SUDEP risk in the future.,701555

Our lab has recentlyimplicated causative variants in poison exons a cryptic alternatively spliced exon causing transcript degradationvia nonsense-mediated decay.

The analysis ofdeep-intronic non-coding variants has provided diagnosis when coding variation cannot be implicated in disease.For example intronic variants in the 20N poison exon of SCN1A results in loss of function causing DravetSyndrome an NDD causing prolonged seizures in the first year of life. Poison exons are a mechanism of generegulation whereby a premature termination codon caused by inclusion of the poison exon induces nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA transcript. Preliminary analysis has shown that poison exon inclusion (PEI) inSCN1A and SCN8A decreases during embryonic brain development inversely proportional to total RNAexpression. The brain is a hotbed of alternative splicing during early neuronal development therefore it isplausible if not probable that novel poison exons remain uncharacterized. The overall hypothesis of this proposalis that PEI is a mechanism to differentiallyregulate gene expression during earlyneuronal developmentand intronic variants affecting PEI in genes of developmental importance contribute to diseasephenotype. In Aim 1 the sodium and calcium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit families will be assessed todetect and characterize novel poison exons. Known and novel PEI will then be determined in the developingbrain using publicly available RNA-seq experiments. In Aim 2 this analysis will be scaled up over 100-fold todetect and assess PEI in over 3000 genes associated with NDD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in thedeveloping brain and the driving forces of PEI evolution will be assessed. Comparative analysis of poison exonswill be conducted using k-means hierarchical clustering and unsupervised random forest machine learningmethodologies to determine prime biological factors driving PEI utilization. In Aim 3 intronic variants will beanalyzed in probands of NDD and ASD in regions of known and hypothetical PEI and the affect these variantshave on disease phenotype will be computationally assessed. These experiments will reveal new insights intoalternative splicing in the developing brain and provide potential genetic explanation of currently unknown NDDdisease phenotype. The research will be conducted at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology which allowsdeveloping scientists to hone skills in a dynamic hands-on environment with supplemental training courses asnecessary. Besides the research outlined in the proposal training will include courses in conduct of responsibleresearch advanced biostatistics machine learning bioinformatics and wet lab techniques next to personaldevelopment to improve oral and written communication and presentation skills as well as time management.,43508

The risk of sudden death is 24times greater in epilepsy patients than the general population and sudden unexplained death inepilepsy (SUDEP) ranks 2nd highest among neurologic diseases in potential years of life lost. Thereare currently no preventative treatments for this devastating epilepsy sequelae. Therefore researchinto mechanisms for prevention of SUDEP is critically important as indicated in the NINDSbenchmarks. Death in most witnessed SUDEP cases results from generalized tonic-clonic seizures(GTCS) leading to terminal apnea. We have developed the DBA/1 mouse model of SUDEP whichmimics human SUDEP in that it exhibits GTCS and seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) thatleads directly to death. Several other labs have recently utilized this model. Research in DBA/1 miceled to the development of the serotonin theory of SUDEP which has received positive support inrecent studies in epilepsy patients. This hypothesis first proposed by our lab is based in part on thefindings that treatments which enhance the action of serotonin block seizure-induced death. TheSUDEP models in which the hypothesis has been tested include the Dravet mice which modelDravet syndrome an intractable form of human epilepsy that has a high risk for SUDEP. Dravet miceare genetically modified to mimic human Dravet syndrome and also show sudden death due to S-IRA. Dravet mice exhibit heat-induced seizures and death can be prevented by timely resuscitationsimilar to DBA/1 mice. Importantly in epilepsy patients non-fatal but significant respiratory deficitsfrequently occur after GTCS and postictal apnea is the most common cause of human SUDEP. Thisproposal will utilize DBA/1 and Dravet mice to test preventative measures for SUDEP. Our recentneuroimaging studies in DBA/1 mice have provided suggestive evidence that a specific brainstemsite- the periaqueductal gray (PAG)-may be critical in preventing seizure-induced death. The PAG isknown to play a critical role to compensate for many types of non-epilepsy-related respiratory deficits.PAG stimulation is currently used in patients to treat chronic pain and will enhance respiration. Wehave preliminarily evaluated the effects of PAG stimulation and found that it enhances respiration inanesthetized DBA/1 mice. Therefore we will explore if PAG electrical stimulation will enhancerespiration and reverse S-IRA following seizures induced in behaving DBA/1 and Dravet mice.Aim 1: To explore if timely electrical stimulation of the PAG can prevent audiogenic seizure-inducedrespiratory arrest (S-IRA) and death in the DBA/1 mouse model of SUDEP.Aim 2: To examine if timely PAG electrical stimulation can prevent seizure-induced sudden death inthe Dravet mouse model of SUDEP induced by elevated temperature.,221250

Dravet syndrome (DS) acatastrophic childhood epilepsy associated with de novo mutations in a voltage-activated sodiumchannel Nav1.1 is one of the most common genetic epilepsies. DS patients suffer with intractableearly-life seizures and debilitating comorbidities. Energy metabolism in comorbidities associatedwith DS remain virtually unexplored. To address this unmet need recent collaborative researchin our two laboratories revealed decreased glycolytic and oxygen consumption rates in a validatedzebrafish model of DS i.e. scn1Lab mutants. This was accompanied by downregulation of keyenzymes pck1 and pck2 in the gluconeogenesis pathway. Here we hypothesize that energydisruption occurs in DS due to glucose dysregulation resulting in seizures and/or comorbidities.The following aims are proposed to test this hypothesis.

GBM metastasizes to different brain regions which makes surgical resectiondifficult. Despite radiation therapy and chemotherapy the median survival timeline is dire at 15months. The major challenges in GBM therapy include late diagnosis metastasis resistance tochemotherapeutics and drug delivery issues due to blood-brain barrier. Thus efforts towardsdeveloping novel pharmacotherapies for GBM are highly warranted. Cancer cells rewire theirmetabolic pathways that are intimately linked to oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Themetabolic reprogramming confers GBM several advantages in survival proliferation metastasisdrug resistance and immune evasion. In addition recent research in the cancer metabolism fieldhas revealed an important lactate shuttle that explains the key role of lactate transfer fromsystemic circulation into tumor microenvironment. Lactate utilization is highly relevant for braintumors such as GBM. Our long-term goal is to pharmacologically target tumor metabolicreprogramming for cancer therapy. Towards that goal we screened a number of metabolicinhibitors in GBM cells that uncovered effectiveness of an FDA-approved antiepileptic drugstiripentol with its putative target lactate dehydrogenase. The objective of this study is to elucidatemolecular mechanism and changes in cancer biology by stiripentol treatment in GBM cells andGBM in vivo models. In addition we will study structure-activity relationships of novel derivativesidentified from stiripentol scaffold to develop potent inhibitors. Additionally formulations ofstiripentol and potent lead compounds will be developed and tested in the tumor xenograft modelof U87 xenografts. Our research will offer novel insights in the mechanistic pharmacology ofstiripentol and can lead to the development of candidate therapeutics for GBM treatment.,164000

Overlapping neuronal and cardiac expression patterns of mutantsodium channels are proposed to underlie the pathophysiology of a number of genetic diseases thatexhibit both epileptic and cardiac phenotypes. The risk of sudden death in epilepsy patients is twentyfour times greater than the general population. Despite advances in recent years to understand themechanisms of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) it has remained elusive. Proposedmechanisms of SUDEP have implicated seizure-induced apnea pulmonary edema dysregulation ofcerebral circulation autonomic dysfunction or cardiac arrhythmias. Besides being the powerhouse ofthe cell the mitochondria is responsible for long term ionic balance in the cell and compromisedmitochondrial function may precede cardiac arrhythmias and epileptic events. Our central hypothesis isthat compromised mitochondrial energetics and ionic homeostasis predisposes DS patients to cardiacarrhythmias seizures and SUDEP-like events. The parent project seeks to uncover novel mechanismsby which cardiac excitability is altered due to compromised mitochondrial energetics in DravetSyndrome (DS) models a form of epilepsy with a high incidence of SUDEP. This supplement will focus onmitochondria mechanisms of epileptogenesis in DS. The significance of this project is that it fills a majorvoid in understanding the mechanism of SUDEP in DS and results from the proposed experiments havethe potential to lead to new therapeutic treatments in DS. While this grant focuses on the role of DSmutations it is our hope that these results may be applicable to other genetic and non-geneticepilepsies that will be the focus of future projects. The proposed studies will provide valuable insight tothe field and may lead to the discovery of several potential therapeutic targets for DS. The mitochondriarepresent an ideal target to investigate as there is growing interest in the mitochondrial mechanisms ofarrhythmogenesis and novel drugs may soon be available to test in epilepsy models.,58969

About 30% of patients donot respond to current therapies. Thus a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive the disease arerequired. By analyzing the expression level of every gene in the rat hippocampus in 3 different epilepsymodels in 11 institutions and 3 time points after seizure induction we have found a core driver of long termgene changes in the epileptic brain. This complex is called Polycomb.

Though there are a number of anti-convulsant drugs available there are noanti-epileptogenic drugs that mitigate the progression of the disease. Using novel bioinformatic approacheswe have identified an endogenous protective program launched by the brain after a prolonged seizure thatfunctions to mitigate pathological changes. Epileptogenesis is associated with a plethora of changes in the brain including alterations in plasticitycell death neurogenesis inflammation and axonal sprouting. These changes occur over timescales rangingfrom many minutes to years but the orchestrating mechanisms are virtually unknown. Long-term changes ingene expression that are associated with epileptogenesis imply that one or more master regulators oftranscription may be coordinating the brain alterations. In order to uncover these transcriptional mechanismswe turned to our recently published genome-wide expression datasets generated by the Epilepsy MicroarrayConsortium (EMC). The datasets consist of mRNA expression profiles of rat dentate granule cells assayed atvarious time points after Status Epilepticus (SE). Using a novel bioinformatic tool that integrates wholegenome transcription factor binding data with gene expression profiles we analyzed datasets derived frombrains induced by 3 different convulsant stimuli each in 2 independent labs and at various time-points. Thisanalysis projected that Polycomb target genes represent the majority of chronically altered genes duringepileptogenesis. REST targets represent a second overlapping group of repressed genes. Polycomb is awell-known driver of life-long changes in gene expression that works by epigenetically silencing genes acrossthe phyla. Our data shows an extremely robust induction of EZH2 protein (the catalytic methylase subunit ofPolycomb) over a 20 day window post SE in neurons. Further we find that antagonizing EZH2 shortly afterSE robustly accelerates the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice suggesting a protective ratherthan pathological role for EZH2. How antagonism of EZH2 later after SE remains to be determined. In this project we will test the hypothesis that an alteration in Polycomb output is a principal modifier ofepileptogenesis. We will ascertain whether EZH2 upregulation is always protective or whether its role evolvesduring the latent period. We will test the effect of an order-of-magnitude change in EZH2 levels on corepressorfunction to see whether such upregulation augments or hampers the repressive abilities of two major EZH2containing complexes: Polycomb and REST. We anticipate that these studies will establish Polycomb asa major orchestrator of the long-term changes associated with epileptogenesis. If so approaches thatmodulate Polycomb function may be of benefit to the 65 million people world-wide that live withepilepsy.,507003

Over 1000 loss-of-function mutations in the VGSC SCN1A have been identifiedduring the last two decades and are the main cause of Dravet syndrome (DS) characterized by recurrent early-life febrile seizures (FSs) severe afebrile epilepsy cognitive and behavioral deficits and a 15-20% mortalityrate. Mutations in the VGSC SCN8A were more recently identified in 2012 and already over 200 gain-of-functionSCN8A mutations have been reported in patients with a range of clinical features including catastrophictreatment-resistant childhood epilepsy autism intellectual disability and developmental delay. Unfortunatelymost anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) fail to adequately treat the broad range of severe seizures and behavioralphenotypes in patients with SCN1A- and SCN8A-derived epilepsy. Thus despite recent progress inpharmacological treatments for DS there remains a need to develop more effective longer lasting treatmentswith fewer side effects. Neuropeptides are well known in animal studies to show great promise for controllingseizures and ameliorating behavioral abnormalities; however they do not readily cross the blood brain barrierand are rapidly metabolized when given systemically. Thus poor brain penetrance is a critical barrier to theclinical application of these promising therapeutics. To overcome this challenge we developed and validated anapproach based on the encapsulation of neuropeptides in nanoparticles conjugated to rabies virus glycoprotein(RVG). Using this approach we have found that intranasal delivery of nanoparticle-encapsulated oxytocin (NP-OT) greatly increases brain penetrance and the capacity of OT to confer robust and sustained increases inresistance to seizures in mouse models of SCN1A and SCN8A dysfunction. We have also extended our strategyto encapsulate neuropeptide Y (NP-NPY) and similarly observed a robust improvement in its ability to conferseizure resistance. In the proposed study we will establish the ability of NP-OT and NP-NPY to amelioratespontaneous seizures and behavioral abnormalities in Scn1a and Scn8a mouse mutants (Aim 1). While the roleof OT in social behavior is well-studied less is known about the mechanisms by which it modulates seizuresusceptibility. Thus we will also identify the cellular and neural circuit mechanisms that contribute to the abilityof OT to increase seizure resistance in the Scn1a and Scn8a mutants (Aim 2). Our long-term goal is to developsafe and effective approaches for the brain delivery of neuropeptides for the treatment of epilepsy and otherneurological disorders.,474192

Therapy that improves function of defective interneurons is notavailable. Structural development and maintenance of interneurons is dependent on trophic support providedby brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation of TrkB receptors. In the undercut (UC) model ofepileptogenic neocortical injury chronic activation of TrkB-Rs with a selective small molecule partial agonist(LM22A-4 LM below) has long-term effects to reverse structural and functional abnormalities in inhibitoryterminals of PV interneurons enhance GABA release and increase the threshold for evoking epileptiformactivity and seizures. In order to determine whether these effects will be applicable to treatment or preventionof epilepsy in other models with different causes for seizures such as genetic epilepsies the Dravet syndrome(DS) mouse will be used in some experiments. Decreases in a membrane sodium channel in PV interneuronsin DS mice causes decreased release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA and development of spontaneousand high temperature-induced seizures. A variety of experimental approaches in DS and UC mice will be usedto determine whether chronic treatment with LM by increasing GABA release from nerve terminals of SOMand PV interneurons or inducing new inhibitory synapse formation will enhance inhibition in cortical networksand suppress epileptiform discharges: 1) immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging will be used to assessalterations in PV and SOM presynaptic terminals including changes in expression of VGAT- and GAD65/67-IR and the calcium sensor protein synaptotagmin 2; 2) analysis of density of SOM/- and PV/gephyrin closeappositions to test for new inhibitory synapse formation induced by TrkB activation; 3) electrophysiologicalanalysis of basic properties of inhibitory synaptic transmission from PV interneurons to pyramidal neurons of invitro slices to detect effects of TrkB activation on unitary IPSCs release probability and transmission failures;3) laser scanning photostimulation of cortical slices from PV/CHR2 and SOM/CHR2 mice to map thedistribution and strength of inhibitory connectivity in neocortical inhibitory circuits; and 4) video/EEG monitoringof implanted mice to assess effects of treatment with LM on spontaneous seizures and hyperthermia-inducedseizures. Results of these experiments will provide information about mechanisms leading from interneuronalabnormalities to development of epilepsy and a potential approach to prophylaxis of epileptogenesis byenhancing trophic support of interneurons.,344405

Mutations in them cause inherited epilepsy migraine chronic pain and periodicparalysis and they are important molecular targets for drugs. A. New insights into structure and function of Navchannels have come from our high-resolution x-ray crystallography of their bacterial ancestor NavAb. We willfurther define the structural basis for key functional properties of mammalian Nav channels by building theircharacteristic structural features into NavAb including the structural basis for voltage-dependent activation ionselectivity and fast inactivation. Based on these results we will determine the structural basis for impaired Navchannel function by mutations that cause periodic paralysis and the chronic pain syndromes erythromelalgiaand paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. B. Failure of learning and memory is a debilitating aspect of aging andneurodegenerative disease yet we do not understand the basic mechanisms of these crucial brain processesand we cannot intervene effectively in these deficits. Learning and memory takes place primarily at synapses.Presynaptic calcium (Cav2.1) channels initiate neurotransmitter release at most synapses in the brain. Theactivity of these channels is tightly regulated by a large complex of signaling proteins including calmodulin andrelated calcium-sensor proteins. Our work implicates Cav2.1 channel regulation in short-term synaptic plasticityin transfected synapses in cultured neurons and in a novel mouse model in which the IM-AA mutation isinserted into Cav2.1. We will further define the molecular and structural mechanism for Cav2.1 channelregulation determine the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels in short-term synaptic plasticity of neuralcircuits and explore the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels and short-term synaptic plasticity in spatiallearning and memory. Our experiments with this unique mouse model will give unique insights into themechanism of short-term presynaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons and its role in integrative bbrainfunction. C. Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a devastating childhood neuropsychiatric disorder caused by de novoheterozygous loss-of-function mutations in Nav1.1. We developed a mouse genetic model with all the featuresof DS including thermally induced and spontaneous seizures ataxia circadian rhythm and sleep disorderscognitive deficit autistic-like features and premature death via SUDEP. Physiological and genetic studiesshow that all these effects are correlated with loss of Na currents and excitability of GABAergic interneuronswithout consistent effects on excitatory neurons which causes imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neuralcircuits. To further advance understanding of pathophysiology and treatment of DS we will determine theneural cells and circuits responsible for DS using specific deletion by the Cre-Lox method identify the sites ofhyperexcitability in neural cells and circuits that appear first in DS mice in vivo and optimize next-generationcombination therapy for seizures status epilepticus cognitive deficit and premature death in DS.,1111616

Along with an increase inopioid use disorders a rise in opioid-related overdose deaths has occurred in the last decade.Chronic pain and opioid abuse are more prevalent than before constituting a public health crisisand exacting a heavy toll on patients caregivers physicians and society. There is a currenttherapeutic challenge for managing opioid use opioid withdrawal symptoms chronic pain and/orassociated anxiety and depression. A severe need remains for alternative and safe therapeuticregimens that properly treat these conditions. We propose to develop a cannabinoid-opioidcombination with opioid-sparing and synergistic analgesic effects to prevent opioid use disorderand overdose addressing the current national opioid epidemic. BDH Pharma LLC completed aproof-of-concept preclinical study of a fixed dose cannabinoid-opioid combination thatdemonstrated opioid-sparing and synergistic analgesic effects with the combination providinggreater analgesia in a rodent model of chronic pain than a standard dose of the opioid alone.Building on that data our SBIR Phase I grant supported a preclinical pharmacokinetic drug-druginteraction and safety study to determine if co-administration altered the pharmacokinetics and/orrespiratory depression related to either compound in rodents. Study results indicated PKparameters remained unaltered except for a decrease in half-life for the opioid. When measuringrespiratory depression we found that the presence of the cannabinoid was able to attenuaterespiratory depression induced by the opioid. Taken together study results have shown that ourlead candidate BDH-001 exhibits synergistic and opioid-sparing analgesic effects and does notdisplay significant drug-drug interactions nor has any deleterious effects on respiratorydepression. This suggests that BDH-001 may have improved analgesia with lower opioid dosesand thereby lower the risk of dependence withdrawal diversion abuse and overdose. Thisproposal will continue the development of BDH-001 by completing pre-formulation andformulation studies to support co-formulation of our FDC for sublingual administration and providerequired data for IND submission. These studies will support the selection of prototypes for short-term stability testing before the clinical supply manufacturing under GMP conditions and long-term stability testing. Upon completion of the proposed Phase II aims and subsequent INDsubmission BDH-001 will be ready for the clinical phase of development with an initial indicationof chronic low back pain.,973920

Synaptic integration and plasticity are the cellular mechanisms of information pro-cessing learning and memory. How these fundamental processes are disrupted in epilepsy is not understood.Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus/Dravet syndrome (GEFS+/DS) is a spectrum of epilepsy disor-ders linked to mutations of the SCN1B gene which cause seizures neurodevelopmental delays and early death.To develop treatments for seizures/cognitive deficits of GEFS+/DS epilepsies there is a critical need to identifymechanisms by which SCN1B mutations disrupt cellular-level information processing and learning. Our long-term goal is to define general principles linking genes to disrupted synaptic integration and plasticity in suchneurodevelopmental disorders. The overall objective of our proposal is to define how the interplay between syn-apses dendritic physiology and somatic physiology impair synaptic integration and plasticity in the Scn1b knock-out (KO) mouse model of GEFS+/DS. Our central hypothesis is loss of Scn1b dysregulates ion channels anddendrite excitability disturbing integration and plasticity. To test this hypothesis we will complete three Aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms of somatic and dendritic hyperexcitability in Scn1b KO neurons.Based on preliminary data our hypothesis is that both dendrites and somata of Scn1b KO CA1 pyramidal neu-rons exhibit intrinsic hyperexcitability in part due to abnormal HCN channel activity. We will test this hypothesiswith whole cell somatic and dendritic recordings immunohistochemistry and cell morphology analyses. Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms of altered synaptic integration in Scn1b KO neurons. Based on ourpreliminary data our hypothesis is that loss of Scn1b fundamentally alters the translation of inputs into outputswith both temporal and spatial synaptic integration abnormally enhanced due to dendritic hyperexcitability anddisrupted synaptic physiology. We will use whole cell recordings to test how temporal and spatial features ofinput/output functions are altered in Scn1b KO neurons in response to naturalistic patterns of synaptic inputs. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that Scn1b disruption alters synaptic learning rules and gating by GABAthat dictate plasticity. Based on our preliminary data our hypothesis is that synaptic learning rules governingLTP and LTD induction are re-shaped due to interplay between suppressed excitation hyperexcitable intrinsicproperties and abnormal gating by aberrant depolarizing inhibition after loss of Scn1b. We will test how inputpatterns that evoke LTP and LTD shift after loss of Scn1b and how inhibition influences this plasticity. Upon successful completion of the proposed research we will have defined detailed mechanisms by whichchanges in neuron intrinsic and synaptic physiology and their interactions re-shape the cellular forms of neuralprocessing and learning in the Scn1b KO mouse model of GEFS+/DS. This contribution will provide mechanisticlinks between genetic changes primary neurophysiology phenotypes and neuronal processing deficits underly-ing seizures and the learning memory and cognition impairments in GEFS+/DS epilepsies.,367775

Dravet syndrome is caused by mutation in the gene SCN1A which encodes the sodium(Na+) channel Nav1.1 How SCN1A mutation leads to the clinical entity known as Dravet syndromeremains unclear; this gap in knowledge has profoundly limited the practical impact that such a diagnosis hason treatment quality of life and long-term outcome for patients with this disorder.Prior work in experimental animal models of Dravet syndrome including Scn1a+/- mice suggests that loss ofNav1.1 leads to epilepsy via dysfunction of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex with themost prominent identified abnormalities being impaired action potential generation in a critical subtype ofinterneuron known as the parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneuron (PV-IN). However data presented hereindicates that surprisingly PV-IN dysfunction is transient being restricted to a brief time window in earlydevelopment with subsequent recovery of high frequency firing. Preliminary data suggests that the specificlocus of pathology in Dravet syndrome is actually PV-IN axons with abnormal action potential propagationleading to conduction delay and synaptic failure even though PV-INs have recovered the ability to generateaction potentials at high frequency. This finding has important implications for the development of noveltreatment approaches for Dravet syndrome such as cell transplantation gene therapy or precision medicine.This new 5-year application from the lab of an early stage investigator uses innovative neuroscienceapproaches to test this new hypothesis as to the mechanism of pathology in Dravet syndrome. Proposedexperiments will establish the molecular identity and physiological properties of Na+ channels in PV-IN axonsin Scn1a+/- mice as compared to wild-type controls using targeted recordings from interneuron axons anddetailed immunohistochemistry of axonal Na+ channels (Aim 1); determine the impact of PV-IN axonaldysfunction on the timing of feedforward inhibition in cerebral cortical circuits (Aim 2); and assess the activityof defined subsets of neurons in awake behaving Scn1a+/- mice using in vivo imaging and electrophysiologyto corroborate in vitro findings (Aim 3).The overall outcome of the proposed experiments will set forth a unifying hypothesis as to the pathophysiologyof Dravet syndrome. Such knowledge is critical to the development of novel targeted therapies for thiscurrently incurable and untreatable disease. The long-term objective of this line of research is to applypreclinical data from experimental model systems to the development of new mechanistically orientedtherapies in human patients.,437492

Dravet syndrome (DS) which results from a loss of function of the sodium channel (NaV)isoform NaV1.1 is associated with a particularly high risk of SUDEP. Notably the unexpected mortality of SUDEPmirrors cases of sudden cardiac death (SCD)  unexpected death resulting from cardiac arrhythmias. Emergingevidence points to physiological commonalities between the brain and the heart suggesting that the verymolecular mechanisms that underlie epileptic disorders could also directly impact the heart leading to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and thereby SCD. However the precise mechanisms by which DS directlyimpact the heart to promote cardiac arrhythmias and SCD remain unknown. Thus we propose to utilize modelsof DS to address this gap in knowledge and to explore the role of direct cardiac remodeling in SCD. Using thesemodels we will test the hypothesis that defects in NaVs that underlie inherited epileptic disorders such as Dravetsyndrome dysregulate cardiac Na+/Ca2+ cycling thereby promoting life-threatening arrhythmias and contributingto SCD. Thus we propose to: 1) Define the phenotypic and structural impacts of tissue-specific expression ofDS-associated defects. 2) Determine the functional impact of DS-associated Na+/Ca2+ signaling nanodomainremodeling on cardiac Ca2+ handling. 3) Assess efficacy of targeting Na+/Ca2+ signaling nanodomains for SCDprevention. Information gleaned from these studies will be used to develop new therapeutic approaches to treatSCD in DS.,424758

Scn1b-/- mice have cell type specific changesin Na+ (INa) and K+ (IK) currents. In addition Scn1b-/- mice have neuronal proliferation migration andpathfinding defects at postnatal day (P)5 that precede seizure onset at ~P10. These data suggested thatalterations in CAM function may contribute to hyperexcitability however new data challenge this idea and offerthe alternative explanation that defective cell adhesion in SCN1B-linked DS may not contribute to seizures butinstead impact other co-morbidities. Preliminary data show that Scn1b-/- mice also have delayed maturation ofneuronal Cl- gradients such that GABAergic signaling remains depolarizing and excitatory until ~P17-18 whichmay contribute to hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The objective of this work is to understand themechanism of hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The central hypothesis is that the mechanism ofhyperexcitability in the Scn1b-/- model of DS is cell type specific changes in INa IK and GABAergic signaling.Further it is proposed that human SCN1B-DS mutations result in loss-of-function with similar defects in ioniccurrents and delayed maturation of GABAergic signaling as observed in Scn1b-/- neurons. The experimentalplan will test three Aims: 1. To determine the mechanism of hyperexcitability resulting from Scn1b deletion; 2.To determine whether human SCN1B-linked DS mutations result in loss-of-function in mouse models; 3. Todetermine the phenotype of SCN1B-linked DS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons.Model choice is key to understanding epilepsy mechanisms. Importantly mice are not small humans. Thuspatient-derived iPSC neuronal models provide essential information regarding human disease.

Rather than relying on a single modelthis project will compare and contrast human and mouse models to understand key mechanistic aspects of thedevelopment of hyperexcitability in DS. Even though SCN1B-linked DS is rare compared to SCN1A-linkeddisease this work may lead to the discovery of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in DS caused bymultiple types of gene mutations.,716609

Our recent investigation of zebrafish mutants featuring a loss-of-function sodium channel (scn1a)mutation (e.g. a gene mutation identified in ~80% of DS patients) focused on drug discovery anddevelopment metabolic dysfunction and behavioral comorbidities. Using a high-throughput phenotype-basedscreening strategy and medicinal chemistry we screened nearly 3000 drugs successfully identified aserotonin (5HT) receptor mechanism underlying anti-seizure activity of clemizole and developed three novelclemizole analogs. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology we generated new zebrafish mutant linesfor chd2 gabrb3 pcdh19 and stxbp1 (e.g. de novo mutations seen in ~20% of DS patients). Interestinglystxbp1 and gabrb3 mutants exhibit epileptic phenotypes. We also designed and manufactured a microfluidicmulti-channel electrode-integrated platform for long-term non-invasive electrophysiology on larval zebrafish(Hong et al. 2016) and developed a calcium imaging-analysis pipeline for studying seizure macro- and micro-networks in vivo (Liu and Baraban 2019). The proposed work will leverage these unique tools. Three specificaims are proposed: (i) to resolve neural networks responsible for seizures in larval DS zebrafish (ii) to performhigh-throughput drug screening using zebrafish and (iii) to further evaluate clemizole and related anti-seizurecompounds. Techniques will include automated locomotion tracking in vivo zebrafish electrophysiologypharmacology and fast calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium- and voltage-sensitive indicators.Our results promise to simultaneously advance our long-term goals (i) to better understand thepathophysiology of genetic epilepsies and (ii) identify promising new treatment options for these intractableconditions.,510261

Nav1.6 is concentrated at the axon initial segment and nodes ofRanvier. Mutations of SCN8A affect many aspects of brain and peripheral nerve function. In 2012 wedescribed the first mutation of SCN8A in a child with early onset epileptic encephalopathy. Since then morethan 150 de novo missense mutations have been identified in this severe form of epilepsy (OMIM # 614558).Our functional characterization of 10 patient mutations demonstrated that gain-of-function mutations resultingin channel hyperactivity are the major pathogenic mechanism underlying SCN8A encephalopathy. Wegenerated a mouse model of the first identified SCN8A mutation p.Asn1768Asp that is widely used forevaluation of therapeutic interventions. We will use this model to isolate a recently discovered genetic modifierthat results in complete rescue of seizures and sudden death. We will also assess the pre-clinicaleffectiveness of antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi reagents that suppress the expression of the dominantSCN8A mutation in the N1768D mouse model. To explore the basis for the severe hypotonia associated withmany SCN8A mutations we have generated a new conditional mouse model with CRE-dependent expressionof the more severe patient mutation p.Arg1872Trp. We will use this new model to examine the role of mutantNav1.6 in specific subsets of neurons at varying stages of development. This conditional model will also beused to directly test the contribution of cardiac expression of hyperactive Nav1.6 to the risk of sudden death.These studies will provide new knowledge regarding pathogenic mechanisms underlying SCN8Aencephalopathy and will test the effectiveness of gene suppression as a therapeutic intervention for thissevere neurological disorder.,509138

Mutations in SCN1Aencoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 are the most common genetic cause of epilepsy.Over 1600 SCN1A mutations have been reported in individuals with epilepsy of varying severity ranging frommild febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome a severe infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy caused byheterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Dravet syndrome is characterized by a variety of seizure typesdevelopmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variableexpressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by geneticmodifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) recapitulate core features of Dravet syndromephenotypes including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reducedsodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons resulting in failure of inhibition and excitatory/inhibitoryimbalance in the brain. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is strongly dependent on strain background. Scn1a+/-mice on the resistant 129 strain (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrastScn1a+/- mice on a [129xB6]F1 strain (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality with50% dying by 1 month of age. Strain-dependent differences are also evident at the level of neuron subtypes.GABAergic interneurons isolated from the susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased sodium current densitycompared to wildtype littermates while sodium current density is preserved in interneurons isolated from129.Scn1a+/- relative to wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for theloss of Nav1.1 while F1 interneurons do not. Based on the strain-dependent difference in phenotypes at thewhole animal and cellular levels we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severitydue to differences in compensatory capacity among neuronal subtypes in the context of Scn1a heterozygousdeletion. We previously mapped several Dravet survival modifier (Dsm) loci that influence premature lethality ofScn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal we will address our hypothesis in three aims. First we will perform finemapping and candidate gene analysis at two Dsm loci on mouse chromosomes 7 and 8. Second we will performsingle cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize differences in cell composition and gene expression in specific cellsubpopulations during the critical phase of phenotype onset in epilepsy susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant129.Scn1a+/- mice. Third we will evaluate the modifier potential of candidate genes in vivo using transcriptionalmodulation to up- and down-regulate candidate gene expression. Results from these studies will identify modifiergenes and pathways that influence phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Identification of modifier genes thatinfluence severity of Dravet syndrome will provide insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and will suggestnovel therapeutic approaches for improved treatment of human patients.,516175

RNA-seq transcriptomic data shows that NaV1.1 is expressed insubsets of ganglion cells thought to transmit particular taste qualities including sweet. My preliminarybehavioral and electrophysiological studies also suggest that NaV1.1 may mediate sweet taste signaltransmission both in an acute i.e. pharmacological block mouse model as well as in a genetic model of NaV1.1haploinsufficiency. In this proposal three different mouse models  one acute and two genetic  will beassessed on peripheral gustatory deficits (Aim 1) and behavioral effects (Aim 2) due to Nav1.1 dysfunction. Thisstudy is innovative because our preliminary data suggest that 1) a single type of sodium channel maydifferentially impact transmission of particular taste qualities and 2) gustatory function may serve as asurrogate measure for NaV1.1 function. The latter would be particularly useful for assessing phenotype severityin Dravet patients which as of yet does not have a robust biomarker to use in assessment.,33803

Despite a large numberof available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) more than one-third of people with epilepsy are not able tocontrol their seizures with medication putting them at higher risk for sudden unexpected death inepilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is a major cause of death in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy andwhile it is distributed across all ages and affects both males and females it is more prevalent inmales. In some epileptic females seizure frequency and severity are known to uctuatecorresponding to changes in sex steroid levels. Possibly sex steroids play a role in the regulation ofseizures and might account for the sex difference in SUDEP incidence.To evaluate the role of sex steroids in seizure and SUDEP susceptibility we used acute and chronictreatment of progesterone and estradiol (P+E) in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome (DS) with aScn1aR1407X/+ loss-of-function mutation. Our preliminary data demonstrate that SUDEP incidenceand the seizure phenotype are improved in female and male mice acutely treated with P+E. Defectsin the serotonin (5-HT) system and decits in GABAergic function are associated with seizures andSUDEP. Animal studies have shown that acute and chronic treatment with P+E can increase 5-HTconcentration in the brain and increase tonic GABA inhibition in the hippocampus. Further sexsteroids are known to stimulate breathing potentially providing a method to rescue the respiratoryphenotype observed in DS mice. Thus we will test the working hypotheses that 1) P+E decreaseSUDEP incidence by reducing seizure frequency and/or severity and stimulating breathing and 2)the anticonvulsant effects of P+E are mediated by serotonin and/or GABA. The effect of chronic andacute P+E treatment on seizures SUDEP incidence and breathing will be assessed through video-EEG/EKG monitoring of spontaneous and hyperthermia-induced seizures. Using DS mice in which 5-HT neurons have been genetically deleted I will determine whether serotonin mediates theanticonvulsant effects conferred by acute and chronic P+E treatment. Lastly I will assess fordifferences in GABA-A mediated tonic inhibition in the hippocampal slice of DS mice compared to wildtype with and without acute application of P+E or their metabolites using whole-cell patch-clamprecordings. The proposed work will provide clearer insight into the role of sex steroids in SUDEPincidence. Further as sex differences in seizure susceptibility are a widespread concern in epilepsyidentifying how sex steroids impact the serotonergic and GABAergic neural pathways could provideclinicians with more effective treatment strategies for both male and female epilepsy patients.,20965

Clinical and animal studies show that seizure-induced respiratoryarrest is the primary event leading to death. Increased serotonin (5-HT) levels in the brain reduce seizure-induced respiratory arrest in provoked seizure models. However it is unclear whether enhancing 5-HT neuro-transmission exerts protective effects on seizure-induced sudden death in spontaneous seizure (epilepsy)models and which 5-HT circuitry is involved in this sudden death in both provoked and spontaneous seizuremodels. These gaps in knowledge have significantly hindered the therapeutics to prevent SUDEP in patients.The long-term goal is to foster effective prevention strategies against SUDEP using approaches targeted tospecific SUDEP mechanisms. The overall objectives of this proposal are to (1) determine the efficacy of 5-HT-enhancing agents in suppressing seizure-induced sudden death and (2) elucidate the involved 5-HT circuitrymechanisms in animal models especially in a widely-used mouse model of human Dravet syndrome (a type ofepilepsy) that displays spontaneous seizures with a high rate of seizure-induced sudden death. The centralhypothesis is that enhanced 5-HT signaling prevents seizure-induced sudden death and that the 5-HT raphe-amygdala circuitry is involved in this sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. The rationale for this proposal isthat a determination of preclinical therapeutic efficacy of 5-HT-enhancing agents and 5-HT neuronal circuitrymechanisms in seizure-induced sudden death is likely to offer a strong scientific framework by which newstrategies against human SUDEP can be developed. The central hypothesis will be tested in the following twospecific aims: 1) Determine the protective effects of enhancing 5-HT neurotransmission on seizure-inducedsudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice; and 2) Elucidate how 5-HT circuitry from raphe nuclei to the amygda-la modifies seizure-induced sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. We will employ a combination of simul-taneous video EEG/ECG/plethysmography monitoring electrophysiology pharmacology and cell-type specifictechnologies (optogenetics and DREADDs) to perform the work in these aims. The proposed research is inno-vative because it defines a novel 5-HT circuitry mechanism of seizure-induced sudden death using optogenet-ics and DREADDs in animal models especially in a human disease model which could conceptually advancethe knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms of SUDEP. The proposed work is significant becausethe expected outcomes will potentially foster targeted pharmacologic and neurostimulatory interventions ofSUDEP to save lives of at-risk patients.,381921

Respiratoryfailure is a leading cause of SUDEP and DS patients' frequently exhibit disordered breathing.However mechanisms underlying respiratory dysfunction in DS are unknown. Evidencesuggests cortical seizures activate inhibitory projections to suppress brainstem function andresult in death; however a yet unexplored possibility is that DS-associated mutations directlyaffect brainstem respiratory centers and serve as a common substrate for both seizure andrespiratory dysfunction. We recently showed that Scn1a transcript is highly expressed inbrainstem inhibitory neurons and expression of a DS-associated Scn1a mutation (A1783V) ininhibitory neurons resulted in cell autonomous loss of neural activity and disruption ofrespiratory function at the cellular and whole-animal levels. Therefore I hypothesize that loss ofScn1a function directly impacts brainstem respiratory control. To test this I will disrupt Scn1afunction globally (Scn1a-/+) specifically in all VGAT+ inhibitory neurons and only in glycinergicneurons (GlyT2:A1783V) and determine whether these animals exhibit disordered breathingseizures or premature death (Aim 1) and altered cellular activity of respiratory neurons (Aim 2).This work will provide novel insight into roles of glycinergic neurons in DS and determine theextent to which loss of Scn1a function directly affect brainstem function.,43004

While no therapies exist to restore gene expression formost disorders recent evidence suggests that many of these genes are actively suppressed by microRNAs.Here we propose to use small synthetic strands of modified DNA (antisense olignonucleotides) to preventmicroRNAs from silencing specific neurodevelopmental genes thus restoring their expression and serving as anovel therapy to treat neurodevelopmental disorders of defined genetic origins.,NINDS,10302244,7/1/2021 0:00,PA-18-358,1R21NS118280-01A1,1,R21,NS,118280,1,A1,"RIDDLE, ROBERT D",7/1/2021 0:00,12/31/2022 0:00,Therapeutic Approaches to Genetic Diseases Study Section[TAG], ,9045128,"PROSSER, BENJAMIN LEARS",Not Applicable,3,PHYSIOLOGY,42250712,GM1XX56LEP58,42250712,GM1XX56LEP58,US,39.953462,-75.193983,6463801,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,PHILADELPHIA,PA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,191046205,UNITED STATES,N,7/1/2021 0:00,12/31/2022 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2021,474874, ,NINDS,344663,130211, ,Project SummaryNeuro-developmental disorders (NDD) are often caused by genetic mutations that lead to haploinsufficiency ora loss-of-gene function. Mutations that cause haploinsufficiency of neurodevelopmental genes affect over200000 births each year and commonly result in congenital malformations intellectual disability epilepsy andmotor and behavioral impairments. While symptomatic treatments exist for most conditions there are notreatments that directly correct the reduced levels of the haploinsufficient gene. Recent research by our groupand others has revealed that many NDD-causing genes are normally under active repression by microRNAssmall non-coding RNAs that function in gene silencing. This raises the possibility of removing this microRNAbrake to increase gene expression and help restore normal function in NDD haploinsufficiency. We hypothesizethat the expression of downregulated genes can be restored through steric-blocking antisense oligonucleotides(ASO) that specifically disrupt gene repression by microRNAs. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis anddemonstrate that ASOs that prevent a particular microRNA from binding to STXBP1 (a common NDD-causinggene) robustly upregulate gene and protein expression. We propose a novel pipeline to systematically developASOs to treat genetic NDD. First we will use bioinformatic and wet lab experimental approaches to identify andvalidate microRNAs that potently repress leading NDD-causing genes. Next we will use a high-throughputmicroRNA reporter assays to screen ASOs that can relieve this microRNA-mediated gene repression. Third wewill take lead ASOs identified from the high-throughput screen and test them on neurons derived from patientswith genetically-defined NDD to determine if they can rescue gene expression and function. Together this workwill establish pre-clinical efficacy for an ASO-based therapy targeting microRNAs to treat neurodevelopmentaldisorders arising from haploinsufficiency and lay the groundwork for first-in-human applications.,474874

While theDS phenotype as in all monogenic epilepsies expresses variably among individuals with the same mutation(suggesting that genetic or environmental modifiers may influence clinical severity) the resultant seizures areoften resistant to conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) some of which in fact exacerbate seizures in thisdisorder. Thus a novel therapeutic AED target in DS is highly desirable.We and others have identified suboptimal removal of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from synapsesdue to reduced expression of astrocytic glutamate transporter (GLT-1) as a contributor to acquired andcongenital epilepsy both in rodents and humans. Notably GLT-1 (termed excitatory amino acid transporter 2EAAT2 in humans) expression when depressed can be enhanced by common beta lactam antibiotics(unrelated to these compounds' antimicrobial properties) and we identified that treatment with ceftriaxone amember of the -lactam class with good blood-brain barrier penetrance suppresses seizures in a rat acquiredepilepsy model. Relevant to DS we documented a clinical observation where children with DS experienceseizure suppression when exposed to beta lactam antibiotics. In parallel in a DS SCN1A haploinsufficiency(Scn1a+/-) mouse model we identified that GLT-1 protein is depressed in cortex and hippocampus whichraises prospects for GLT-1 deficiency as a plausible novel therapeutic target in DS.Accordingly we propose a set of exploratory experiments aimed to (1) test the clinical utility of GLT-1enhancement by ceftriaxone (or analogous compound) in DS treatment. (2) test whether GLT-1 reduction is anScn1a+/- endophenotype or the product of recurrent seizures and (3) characterize the developmentalregulation of GLT-1 expression in the Scn1a+/- mouse.Given that seizures in DS do not respond to conventional AEDs our proposed experiments will be the first steptoward a novel adjunctive antiepileptic treatment in this devasting syndrome. Beyond DS the proposedexperiments will provide insight into the role of astrocytic glutamate transport in milder variants of SCN1Ahaploinsufficiency and in other epilepsies. As GLT-1 upregulation may be accomplished by safe andinexpensive drugs we anticipate that favorable results from the proposed studies will translate rapidly tohuman trials in DS or in related disorders.,486750

Animalmodels are increasingly used to understand disease mechanisms and to screen promising therapeuticapproaches. Animal epilepsy model use typically requires expensive and labor-intensive experimentation withinvasive EEG measurements being the preferred method of validation. This severely limits the pace and scale ofinvestigation. In models of acquired epilepsy animals usually undergo treatment to induce status epilepticusa period of unremitting seizurefollowed by a latent period during which the brain rewires itself to generatespontaneously recurring seizures the hallmark of chronic epilepsy. The duration of the latent period and thelikelihood that an animal will develop epilepsy are both uncertain. Animals must be observed for weeks toconfirm epilepsy before they are ready for experimentation. During this latent period seizures are commonlydocumented by visual observation or video review which are tedious and prone to error. A commercial systemfor automated noninvasive seizure detection would therefore be invaluable to epilepsy researchers.Signal Solutions LLC has developed piezoelectric sensor technologies for noninvasive high-throughputbehavioral monitoring in rodents. This is being used by sleep/circadian researchers around the world anddiscriminates sleep from wakefulness with >90% accuracy. The Sunderam Lab at the University of Kentuckyhas further demonstrated that these piezo sensors can distinguish REM and NREM stages of sleep in mice.To address the needs of epilepsy researchers we performed a Phase I STTR study to: 1. Test the feasibility ofepilepsy onset detection in rodents using noninvasive piezo film sensors; 2. Validate piezo detections againstsimultaneous EEG recordings in rodents with epilepsy; and 3. Test the feasibility of using smaller profile piezosensors and an infrared imager for seizure screening and verification. The study successfully confirmed thefeasibility of these aims.In this Phase II STTR proposal we will further develop methods for accurate noninvasive seizure screening inrodent models through the following objectives: 1. Develop algorithms for detection of both overt and subtleseizures using small form factor piezo sensors; 2. Send a prototype system out for beta testing on differentanimal models and refine the system based on feedback; 3.

Our proposal aims to remedythis by engineering novel AAV capsids to allow enhanced neuronal transduction of primate brain developing asuite of optimized AAV vectors for more precise cell type and cell class-selective delivery of transgenes andtesting if virus-mediated restoration of sodium channel function in forebrain inhibitory neurons can correct thedevastating neurological deficits of Dravet syndrome.,NIMH,10249365,8/4/2021 0:00,RFA-MH-19-135,5UG3MH120095-02,5,UG3,MH,120095,2, ,"KIM, DOUGLAS S",9/1/2020 0:00,6/30/2023 0:00,ZMH1-ERB-Q(03), ,8084887,"TING, JONATHAN T","KALUME, FRANCK K; LEIN, ED ; LEVI, BOAZ PIRIE",7,Unavailable,137210949,NFHEUCKBFMU4,137210949,NFHEUCKBFMU4,US,47.650084,-122.351604,10012306,ALLEN INSTITUTE,SEATTLE,WA,Research Institutes,981094307,UNITED STATES,N,8/3/2021 0:00,6/30/2022 0:00,242,Non-SBIR/STTR,2021,1239569, ,NIMH,946502,293067, ,Abstract:Many cell types together assemble the functional circuitry of the human brain. For over a century neuroscientistshave categorized brain cell types by their features including shape position physiology molecules andfunction. Single cell transcriptomics studies are now defining molecular cell types at a resolution not previouslypossible uncovering a taxonomy of hundreds to thousands of brain cell types. These studies have also revealeddramatic differences in molecular signatures of homologous cell types across species showing decisively thatthe difference between mouse and human brain is not simply the total number of neurons. However the functionof each cell class or type in brain circuitry and dysfunction in disease is only beginning to be evaluated. Tocharacterize the roles of human brain cell classes in normal function and disease it is critical that tools bedeveloped to allow genetic access to cell classes in vivo. Such tools would enable precise therapeutic genedelivery to brain cell classes permitting targeted treatment for class-specific etiologies like some epilepsies.Few genetic tools are available to mark and manipulate cell classes and types in non-genetically tractablespecies like human and non-human primate (NHP). Viruses including adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)containing cell class and type selective enhancers can be leveraged to gain genetic access to and drive geneexpression in specific brain cell classes in these species. We have initiated a project through the BRAIN Initiativeto generate and validate reporter AAVs to mark specific cell classes in the mouse cortex in vivo and in humanneocortical tissue ex vivo. Our groups have engineered AAV vectors and optimized capsids to access neuronsand express transgenes in many discrete cell classes and types in mouse and primate. New and improved AAVtools promise to fuel human brain scientific discovery and clinical progress but one impediment has been thecostly and time-consuming process of validating new vectors in primates.We present three Aims to translate these promising new AAV vectors into a high-value set of primate-optimizedtools that could eventually be used for gene therapies in humans. First we will develop a platform for screeningAAV vectors in NHP ex vivo brain slices followed by individual validation of promising vectors in NHP in vivoand human ex vivo brain slice cultures. Second we will identify optimal AAV capsids to: a) support widespreadNHP neuronal transduction in vivo when applied intravenously or to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) two preferredroutes of delivery for human CNS gene therapy and b) support AAV transduction of human primary brain tissueex vivo. Third we will perform proof-of-concept experiments using cell class-selective vectors to express atherapeutic transgene in defined classes to treat a severe and intractable form of childhood epilepsy calledDravet syndrome (DS). These experiments represent a significant step towards converting cell class-selectiveAAVs into first-in-class viral tools optimized for in vivo NHP brain studies and human gene therapy applications.,1239569

Uncontrolled tonic-clonic seizures place patients at high riskof sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) a major cause of mortality in patients withdrug-resistant epilepsy. The high-fat very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (KDs) help somepatients with uncontrolled epilepsy especially children but have been described as unpalatableand are often not tolerated by patients leading to high rates of non-compliance.We have obtained preliminary data from a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome (DS) a devastatingchildhood-onset epilepsy with refractory seizures and a high incidence of SUDEP and foundseizure-induced death is greatly reduced by supplementing their diet with milk whey (WD). ThisWD was just as protective as two different KDs but did not require an increase in ketone bodies.Moreover our preliminary studies suggest that a WD and KDs increase 5-HT levels and 5-HTrelease in the brain of mice. This is important as 5-HT is known to inhibit seizures and also playsa critical role in control of breathing. Defects in the 5-HT system have been linked to bothrespiratory dysfunction and SUDEP. In this proposed project we will test the hypotheses that 1)whey prevents seizure-induced death by reducing seizure frequency and/or stimulating postictalbreathing via increased brain 5-HT and 2) whey prevents postictal death by reversing the basicunderlying defect in DS mice which is thought to be a decrease in excitability of GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. To determine how a WD affects seizures breathing and neurochemistrywe will use video-EEG/EKG to evaluate the anticonvulsant effects of a WD on spontaneous andhyperthermia-induced seizures and in vivo microdialysis with high performance liquidchromatography to measure extracellular 5-HT in the amygdala a region implicated in seizurepropagation and postictal apnea. We will perform patch clamp recordings on hippocampal brainslices from WD-fed DS mice to evaluate intrinsic electrophysiological properties of interneuronsand pyramidal neurons and will determine if changes in excitability due to the WD are mediatedby increased 5-HT signaling. These studies will provide preclinical data that may guide futureclinical trials to evaluate milk whey supplementation as a safe and healthy dietary therapy fordrug-resistant epilepsy that is more palatable and effective than the KD. These experiments mayalso lead to new avenues of treatment targeted at the serotonergic mechanisms engaged by milkwhey.,46036

Over 1000 loss-of-function mutations in the VGSC SCN1A have been identifiedduring the last two decades and are the main cause of Dravet syndrome (DS) characterized by recurrent early-life febrile seizures (FSs) severe afebrile epilepsy cognitive and behavioral deficits and a 15-20% mortalityrate. Mutations in the VGSC SCN8A were more recently identified in 2012 and already over 200 gain-of-functionSCN8A mutations have been reported in patients with a range of clinical features including catastrophictreatment-resistant childhood epilepsy autism intellectual disability and developmental delay. Unfortunatelymost anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) fail to adequately treat the broad range of severe seizures and behavioralphenotypes in patients with SCN1A- and SCN8A-derived epilepsy. Thus despite recent progress inpharmacological treatments for DS there remains a need to develop more effective longer lasting treatmentswith fewer side effects. Neuropeptides are well known in animal studies to show great promise for controllingseizures and ameliorating behavioral abnormalities; however they do not readily cross the blood brain barrierand are rapidly metabolized when given systemically. Thus poor brain penetrance is a critical barrier to theclinical application of these promising therapeutics. To overcome this challenge we developed and validated anapproach based on the encapsulation of neuropeptides in nanoparticles conjugated to rabies virus glycoprotein(RVG). Using this approach we have found that intranasal delivery of nanoparticle-encapsulated oxytocin (NP-OT) greatly increases brain penetrance and the capacity of OT to confer robust and sustained increases inresistance to seizures in mouse models of SCN1A and SCN8A dysfunction. We have also extended our strategyto encapsulate neuropeptide Y (NP-NPY) and similarly observed a robust improvement in its ability to conferseizure resistance. In the proposed study we will establish the ability of NP-OT and NP-NPY to amelioratespontaneous seizures and behavioral abnormalities in Scn1a and Scn8a mouse mutants (Aim 1). While the roleof OT in social behavior is well-studied less is known about the mechanisms by which it modulates seizuresusceptibility. Thus we will also identify the cellular and neural circuit mechanisms that contribute to the abilityof OT to increase seizure resistance in the Scn1a and Scn8a mutants (Aim 2). Our long-term goal is to developsafe and effective approaches for the brain delivery of neuropeptides for the treatment of epilepsy and otherneurological disorders.,517488

The analysis ofdeep-intronic non-coding variants has provided diagnosis when coding variation cannot be implicated in disease.For example intronic variants in the 20N poison exon of SCN1A results in loss of function causing DravetSyndrome an NDD causing prolonged seizures in the first year of life. Poison exons are a mechanism of generegulation whereby a premature termination codon caused by inclusion of the poison exon induces nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA transcript. Preliminary analysis has shown that poison exon inclusion (PEI) inSCN1A and SCN8A decreases during embryonic brain development inversely proportional to total RNAexpression. The brain is a hotbed of alternative splicing during early neuronal development therefore it isplausible if not probable that novel poison exons remain uncharacterized. The overall hypothesis of this proposalis that PEI is a mechanism to differentiallyregulate gene expression during earlyneuronal developmentand intronic variants affecting PEI in genes of developmental importance contribute to diseasephenotype. In Aim 1 the sodium and calcium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit families will be assessed todetect and characterize novel poison exons. Known and novel PEI will then be determined in the developingbrain using publicly available RNA-seq experiments. In Aim 2 this analysis will be scaled up over 100-fold todetect and assess PEI in over 3000 genes associated with NDD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in thedeveloping brain and the driving forces of PEI evolution will be assessed. Comparative analysis of poison exonswill be conducted using k-means hierarchical clustering and unsupervised random forest machine learningmethodologies to determine prime biological factors driving PEI utilization. In Aim 3 intronic variants will beanalyzed in probands of NDD and ASD in regions of known and hypothetical PEI and the affect these variantshave on disease phenotype will be computationally assessed. These experiments will reveal new insights intoalternative splicing in the developing brain and provide potential genetic explanation of currently unknown NDDdisease phenotype. The research will be conducted at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology which allowsdeveloping scientists to hone skills in a dynamic hands-on environment with supplemental training courses asnecessary. Besides the research outlined in the proposal training will include courses in conduct of responsibleresearch advanced biostatistics machine learning bioinformatics and wet lab techniques next to personaldevelopment to improve oral and written communication and presentation skills as well as time management.,42792

SUDEPmechanisms are not understood although there is evidence to implicate apnea autonomic dysfunction andcardiac arrhythmias. We will take advantage of recent progress in the understanding of SUDEP risk in the geneticepilepsies to investigate the role of cardiac arrhythmias. SUDEP risk varies in a gene-specific manner. Loss-of-function variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) genes SCN1A or SCN1B are identified inpatients with Dravet syndrome (DS) and gain-of-function variants in the VGSC SCN8A are found in patients withEarly Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 13 (EIEE13). DS and EIEE13 patients have the highest SUDEP risk upto 20%. In contrast variants in chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) are also associated withearly onset EE but SUDEP has not been reported in this population. SCN1A- SCN1B- SCN8A- and CHD2-linked epilepsies are developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) severe childhood epilepsiesassociated with cognitive and behavioral impairments. The familial focal epilepsies are attributed to pathogenicvariants in DEPDC5 encoding a member of the GATOR complex in the mTOR pathway. SUDEP is reported in10% of these patients. Because VGSC genes are expressed in both heart and brain we have proposed thatcardiac arrhythmias contribute to the mechanism of SUDEP in channelopathy-linked genetic epilepsies. Ouroverall goal is to understand the mechanisms of SUDEP in the genetic epilepsies. Our objectives are to usepatient-derived or transgenic mouse cardiac myocytes (CMs) to understand how epileptic VGSC gene mutationsalter CM function and arrhythmogenic potential and to determine whether similar changes are found in non-ionchannel epilepsy genes that are expressed in the heart. Our central hypothesis is that both ion channel and non-ion channel genetic epilepsies with high but not low SUDEP risk exhibit pro-arrhythmogenic changes in patient-derived CMs and mouse models. To ask whether abnormal CM excitability also occurs in a non-ion channelgenetic epilepsy with high SUDEP risk we will investigate DEPDC5 variant iPSC-CMs and Depdc5-/- mice.Finally we will examine Chd2-/- mice and human iPSC-CMs with variants in CHD2 a non-ion channel gene witha low SUDEP risk to test whether altered CM excitability is specific to genetic epilepsies with high SUDEP rates.Like the VGSCs DEPDC5 and CHD2 are expressed in brain and heart. Our Specific Aims are: 1. To determinethe effects of SCN1A SCN1B and SCN8A epilepsy variants on CM excitability using patient-derived iPSC-CMs.2. To ascertain whether CMs from DEPDC5 patients or Depdc5+/- mice display abnormal excitability and whetherDepdc5+/- mice have arrhythmia. 3. To determine whether CMs from CHD2 patients or Chd2+/- mice displayabnormal excitability and whether Chd2+/- mice have arrhythmia. There are no effective therapies for any of thegenetic epilepsies and no reliable biomarkers for SUDEP risk. This work may lead to the discovery of diagnosticbiomarkers for SUDEP risk in the future.,706235

Synaptic integration and plasticity are the cellular mechanisms of information pro-cessing learning and memory. How these fundamental processes are disrupted in epilepsy is not understood.Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus/Dravet syndrome (GEFS+/DS) is a spectrum of epilepsy disor-ders linked to mutations of the SCN1B gene which cause seizures neurodevelopmental delays and early death.To develop treatments for seizures/cognitive deficits of GEFS+/DS epilepsies there is a critical need to identifymechanisms by which SCN1B mutations disrupt cellular-level information processing and learning. Our long-term goal is to define general principles linking genes to disrupted synaptic integration and plasticity in suchneurodevelopmental disorders. The overall objective of our proposal is to define how the interplay between syn-apses dendritic physiology and somatic physiology impair synaptic integration and plasticity in the Scn1b knock-out (KO) mouse model of GEFS+/DS. Our central hypothesis is loss of Scn1b dysregulates ion channels anddendrite excitability disturbing integration and plasticity. To test this hypothesis we will complete three Aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms of somatic and dendritic hyperexcitability in Scn1b KO neurons.Based on preliminary data our hypothesis is that both dendrites and somata of Scn1b KO CA1 pyramidal neu-rons exhibit intrinsic hyperexcitability in part due to abnormal HCN channel activity. We will test this hypothesiswith whole cell somatic and dendritic recordings immunohistochemistry and cell morphology analyses. Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms of altered synaptic integration in Scn1b KO neurons. Based on ourpreliminary data our hypothesis is that loss of Scn1b fundamentally alters the translation of inputs into outputswith both temporal and spatial synaptic integration abnormally enhanced due to dendritic hyperexcitability anddisrupted synaptic physiology. We will use whole cell recordings to test how temporal and spatial features ofinput/output functions are altered in Scn1b KO neurons in response to naturalistic patterns of synaptic inputs. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that Scn1b disruption alters synaptic learning rules and gating by GABAthat dictate plasticity. Based on our preliminary data our hypothesis is that synaptic learning rules governingLTP and LTD induction are re-shaped due to interplay between suppressed excitation hyperexcitable intrinsicproperties and abnormal gating by aberrant depolarizing inhibition after loss of Scn1b. We will test how inputpatterns that evoke LTP and LTD shift after loss of Scn1b and how inhibition influences this plasticity. Upon successful completion of the proposed research we will have defined detailed mechanisms by whichchanges in neuron intrinsic and synaptic physiology and their interactions re-shape the cellular forms of neuralprocessing and learning in the Scn1b KO mouse model of GEFS+/DS. This contribution will provide mechanisticlinks between genetic changes primary neurophysiology phenotypes and neuronal processing deficits underly-ing seizures and the learning memory and cognition impairments in GEFS+/DS epilepsies.,367775

About 30% of patients donot respond to current therapies. Thus a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive the disease arerequired. By analyzing the expression level of every gene in the rat hippocampus in 3 different epilepsymodels in 11 institutions and 3 time points after seizure induction we have found a core driver of long termgene changes in the epileptic brain. This complex is called Polycomb. This project will study the role ofPolycomb in the progression of epilepsy.,NINDS,10167800,4/26/2021 0:00,PA-18-484,5R01NS108756-03,5,R01,NS,108756,3, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",8/1/2019 0:00,5/31/2024 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BDCN-E(02)M], ,7052279,"ROOPRA, AVTAR S","DINGLEDINE, RAYMOND J",2,NEUROSCIENCES,161202122,LCLSJAGTNZQ7,161202122,LCLSJAGTNZQ7,US,43.068519,-89.400858,578503,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,MADISON,WI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,537151218,UNITED STATES,N,6/1/2021 0:00,5/31/2022 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2021,507003, ,NINDS,403427,103576, ,Project Summary/Abstract Epilepsy is the 4th most prevalent neurological disorder after stroke Alzheimers and migraine with anincidence of 1 in 26 individuals. Though there are a number of anti-convulsant drugs available there are noanti-epileptogenic drugs that mitigate the progression of the disease. Using novel bioinformatic approacheswe have identified an endogenous protective program launched by the brain after a prolonged seizure thatfunctions to mitigate pathological changes. Epileptogenesis is associated with a plethora of changes in the brain including alterations in plasticitycell death neurogenesis inflammation and axonal sprouting. These changes occur over timescales rangingfrom many minutes to years but the orchestrating mechanisms are virtually unknown. Long-term changes ingene expression that are associated with epileptogenesis imply that one or more master regulators oftranscription may be coordinating the brain alterations. In order to uncover these transcriptional mechanismswe turned to our recently published genome-wide expression datasets generated by the Epilepsy MicroarrayConsortium (EMC). The datasets consist of mRNA expression profiles of rat dentate granule cells assayed atvarious time points after Status Epilepticus (SE). Using a novel bioinformatic tool that integrates wholegenome transcription factor binding data with gene expression profiles we analyzed datasets derived frombrains induced by 3 different convulsant stimuli each in 2 independent labs and at various time-points. Thisanalysis projected that Polycomb target genes represent the majority of chronically altered genes duringepileptogenesis. REST targets represent a second overlapping group of repressed genes. Polycomb is awell-known driver of life-long changes in gene expression that works by epigenetically silencing genes acrossthe phyla. Our data shows an extremely robust induction of EZH2 protein (the catalytic methylase subunit ofPolycomb) over a 20 day window post SE in neurons. Further we find that antagonizing EZH2 shortly afterSE robustly accelerates the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice suggesting a protective ratherthan pathological role for EZH2. How antagonism of EZH2 later after SE remains to be determined. In this project we will test the hypothesis that an alteration in Polycomb output is a principal modifier ofepileptogenesis. We will ascertain whether EZH2 upregulation is always protective or whether its role evolvesduring the latent period. We will test the effect of an order-of-magnitude change in EZH2 levels on corepressorfunction to see whether such upregulation augments or hampers the repressive abilities of two major EZH2containing complexes: Polycomb and REST. We anticipate that these studies will establish Polycomb asa major orchestrator of the long-term changes associated with epileptogenesis. If so approaches thatmodulate Polycomb function may be of benefit to the 65 million people world-wide that live withepilepsy.,507003

Dravet syndrome (DS) acatastrophic childhood epilepsy associated with de novo mutations in a voltage-activated sodiumchannel Nav1.1 is one of the most common genetic epilepsies. DS patients suffer with intractableearly-life seizures and debilitating comorbidities. Energy metabolism in comorbidities associatedwith DS remain virtually unexplored. To address this unmet need recent collaborative researchin our two laboratories revealed decreased glycolytic and oxygen consumption rates in a validatedzebrafish model of DS i.e. scn1Lab mutants. This was accompanied by downregulation of keyenzymes pck1 and pck2 in the gluconeogenesis pathway. Here we hypothesize that energydisruption occurs in DS due to glucose dysregulation resulting in seizures and/or comorbidities.The following aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine if pharmacologicalinhibition of pck1 and/or pck2 phenocopies metabolic and behavioral deficits in wildtype zebrafish.Aim 2 will determine if pharmacological manipulation of pck1 and/or pck2 is therapeutic inscn1Lab mutant zebrafish. These studies promise to provide a mechanistic explanation of themetabolic defects observed in DS and could suggest novel avenues for therapeutic intervention.,468789

RNA-seq transcriptomic data shows that NaV1.1 is expressed insubsets of ganglion cells thought to transmit particular taste qualities including sweet. My preliminarybehavioral and electrophysiological studies also suggest that NaV1.1 may mediate sweet taste signaltransmission both in an acute i.e. pharmacological block mouse model as well as in a genetic model of NaV1.1haploinsufficiency. In this proposal three different mouse models  one acute and two genetic  will beassessed on peripheral gustatory deficits (Aim 1) and behavioral effects (Aim 2) due to Nav1.1 dysfunction. Thisstudy is innovative because our preliminary data suggest that 1) a single type of sodium channel maydifferentially impact transmission of particular taste qualities and 2) gustatory function may serve as asurrogate measure for NaV1.1 function. The latter would be particularly useful for assessing phenotype severityin Dravet patients which as of yet does not have a robust biomarker to use in assessment.,33287

Respiratoryfailure is a leading cause of SUDEP and DS patients' frequently exhibit disordered breathing.However mechanisms underlying respiratory dysfunction in DS are unknown. Evidencesuggests cortical seizures activate inhibitory projections to suppress brainstem function andresult in death; however a yet unexplored possibility is that DS-associated mutations directlyaffect brainstem respiratory centers and serve as a common substrate for both seizure andrespiratory dysfunction. We recently showed that Scn1a transcript is highly expressed inbrainstem inhibitory neurons and expression of a DS-associated Scn1a mutation (A1783V) ininhibitory neurons resulted in cell autonomous loss of neural activity and disruption ofrespiratory function at the cellular and whole-animal levels. Therefore I hypothesize that loss ofScn1a function directly impacts brainstem respiratory control. To test this I will disrupt Scn1afunction globally (Scn1a-/+) specifically in all VGAT+ inhibitory neurons and only in glycinergicneurons (GlyT2:A1783V) and determine whether these animals exhibit disordered breathingseizures or premature death (Aim 1) and altered cellular activity of respiratory neurons (Aim 2).This work will provide novel insight into roles of glycinergic neurons in DS and determine theextent to which loss of Scn1a function directly affect brainstem function.,41078

Therapy that improves function of defective interneurons is notavailable. Structural development and maintenance of interneurons is dependent on trophic support providedby brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation of TrkB receptors. In the undercut (UC) model ofepileptogenic neocortical injury chronic activation of TrkB-Rs with a selective small molecule partial agonist(LM22A-4 LM below) has long-term effects to reverse structural and functional abnormalities in inhibitoryterminals of PV interneurons enhance GABA release and increase the threshold for evoking epileptiformactivity and seizures. In order to determine whether these effects will be applicable to treatment or preventionof epilepsy in other models with different causes for seizures such as genetic epilepsies the Dravet syndrome(DS) mouse will be used in some experiments. Decreases in a membrane sodium channel in PV interneuronsin DS mice causes decreased release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA and development of spontaneousand high temperature-induced seizures. A variety of experimental approaches in DS and UC mice will be usedto determine whether chronic treatment with LM by increasing GABA release from nerve terminals of SOMand PV interneurons or inducing new inhibitory synapse formation will enhance inhibition in cortical networksand suppress epileptiform discharges: 1) immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging will be used to assessalterations in PV and SOM presynaptic terminals including changes in expression of VGAT- and GAD65/67-IR and the calcium sensor protein synaptotagmin 2; 2) analysis of density of SOM/- and PV/gephyrin closeappositions to test for new inhibitory synapse formation induced by TrkB activation; 3) electrophysiologicalanalysis of basic properties of inhibitory synaptic transmission from PV interneurons to pyramidal neurons of invitro slices to detect effects of TrkB activation on unitary IPSCs release probability and transmission failures;3) laser scanning photostimulation of cortical slices from PV/CHR2 and SOM/CHR2 mice to map thedistribution and strength of inhibitory connectivity in neocortical inhibitory circuits; and 4) video/EEG monitoringof implanted mice to assess effects of treatment with LM on spontaneous seizures and hyperthermia-inducedseizures. Results of these experiments will provide information about mechanisms leading from interneuronalabnormalities to development of epilepsy and a potential approach to prophylaxis of epileptogenesis byenhancing trophic support of interneurons.,459247

We will analyze the molecular and cellular mechanism of short-term synaptic plasticity which is important for encoding and transmitting information in neurons.

Mutations in them cause inherited epilepsy migraine chronic pain and periodicparalysis and they are important molecular targets for drugs. A. New insights into structure and function of Navchannels have come from our high-resolution x-ray crystallography of their bacterial ancestor NavAb. We willfurther define the structural basis for key functional properties of mammalian Nav channels by building theircharacteristic structural features into NavAb including the structural basis for voltage-dependent activation ionselectivity and fast inactivation. Based on these results we will determine the structural basis for impaired Navchannel function by mutations that cause periodic paralysis and the chronic pain syndromes erythromelalgiaand paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. B. Failure of learning and memory is a debilitating aspect of aging andneurodegenerative disease yet we do not understand the basic mechanisms of these crucial brain processesand we cannot intervene effectively in these deficits. Learning and memory takes place primarily at synapses.Presynaptic calcium (Cav2.1) channels initiate neurotransmitter release at most synapses in the brain. Theactivity of these channels is tightly regulated by a large complex of signaling proteins including calmodulin andrelated calcium-sensor proteins. Our work implicates Cav2.1 channel regulation in short-term synaptic plasticityin transfected synapses in cultured neurons and in a novel mouse model in which the IM-AA mutation isinserted into Cav2.1. We will further define the molecular and structural mechanism for Cav2.1 channelregulation determine the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels in short-term synaptic plasticity of neuralcircuits and explore the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels and short-term synaptic plasticity in spatiallearning and memory. Our experiments with this unique mouse model will give unique insights into themechanism of short-term presynaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons and its role in integrative bbrainfunction. C. Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a devastating childhood neuropsychiatric disorder caused by de novoheterozygous loss-of-function mutations in Nav1.1. We developed a mouse genetic model with all the featuresof DS including thermally induced and spontaneous seizures ataxia circadian rhythm and sleep disorderscognitive deficit autistic-like features and premature death via SUDEP. Physiological and genetic studiesshow that all these effects are correlated with loss of Na currents and excitability of GABAergic interneuronswithout consistent effects on excitatory neurons which causes imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neuralcircuits. To further advance understanding of pathophysiology and treatment of DS we will determine theneural cells and circuits responsible for DS using specific deletion by the Cre-Lox method identify the sites ofhyperexcitability in neural cells and circuits that appear first in DS mice in vivo and optimize next-generationcombination therapy for seizures status epilepticus cognitive deficit and premature death in DS.,1111616

Mutations in SCN1Aencoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 are the most common genetic cause of epilepsy.Over 1600 SCN1A mutations have been reported in individuals with epilepsy of varying severity ranging frommild febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome a severe infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy caused byheterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Dravet syndrome is characterized by a variety of seizure typesdevelopmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variableexpressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by geneticmodifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) recapitulate core features of Dravet syndromephenotypes including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reducedsodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons resulting in failure of inhibition and excitatory/inhibitoryimbalance in the brain. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is strongly dependent on strain background. Scn1a+/-mice on the resistant 129 strain (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrastScn1a+/- mice on a [129xB6]F1 strain (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality with50% dying by 1 month of age. Strain-dependent differences are also evident at the level of neuron subtypes.GABAergic interneurons isolated from the susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased sodium current densitycompared to wildtype littermates while sodium current density is preserved in interneurons isolated from129.Scn1a+/- relative to wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for theloss of Nav1.1 while F1 interneurons do not. Based on the strain-dependent difference in phenotypes at thewhole animal and cellular levels we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severitydue to differences in compensatory capacity among neuronal subtypes in the context of Scn1a heterozygousdeletion. We previously mapped several Dravet survival modifier (Dsm) loci that influence premature lethality ofScn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal we will address our hypothesis in three aims. First we will perform finemapping and candidate gene analysis at two Dsm loci on mouse chromosomes 7 and 8. Second we will performsingle cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize differences in cell composition and gene expression in specific cellsubpopulations during the critical phase of phenotype onset in epilepsy susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant129.Scn1a+/- mice. Third we will evaluate the modifier potential of candidate genes in vivo using transcriptionalmodulation to up- and down-regulate candidate gene expression. Results from these studies will identify modifiergenes and pathways that influence phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Identification of modifier genes thatinfluence severity of Dravet syndrome will provide insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and will suggestnovel therapeutic approaches for improved treatment of human patients.,516175

Dravet syndrome is caused by mutation in the gene SCN1A which encodes the sodium(Na+) channel Nav1.1 How SCN1A mutation leads to the clinical entity known as Dravet syndromeremains unclear; this gap in knowledge has profoundly limited the practical impact that such a diagnosis hason treatment quality of life and long-term outcome for patients with this disorder.Prior work in experimental animal models of Dravet syndrome including Scn1a+/- mice suggests that loss ofNav1.1 leads to epilepsy via dysfunction of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex with themost prominent identified abnormalities being impaired action potential generation in a critical subtype ofinterneuron known as the parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneuron (PV-IN). However data presented hereindicates that surprisingly PV-IN dysfunction is transient being restricted to a brief time window in earlydevelopment with subsequent recovery of high frequency firing. Preliminary data suggests that the specificlocus of pathology in Dravet syndrome is actually PV-IN axons with abnormal action potential propagationleading to conduction delay and synaptic failure even though PV-INs have recovered the ability to generateaction potentials at high frequency. This finding has important implications for the development of noveltreatment approaches for Dravet syndrome such as cell transplantation gene therapy or precision medicine.This new 5-year application from the lab of an early stage investigator uses innovative neuroscienceapproaches to test this new hypothesis as to the mechanism of pathology in Dravet syndrome. Proposedexperiments will establish the molecular identity and physiological properties of Na+ channels in PV-IN axonsin Scn1a+/- mice as compared to wild-type controls using targeted recordings from interneuron axons anddetailed immunohistochemistry of axonal Na+ channels (Aim 1); determine the impact of PV-IN axonaldysfunction on the timing of feedforward inhibition in cerebral cortical circuits (Aim 2); and assess the activityof defined subsets of neurons in awake behaving Scn1a+/- mice using in vivo imaging and electrophysiologyto corroborate in vitro findings (Aim 3).The overall outcome of the proposed experiments will set forth a unifying hypothesis as to the pathophysiologyof Dravet syndrome. Such knowledge is critical to the development of novel targeted therapies for thiscurrently incurable and untreatable disease. The long-term objective of this line of research is to applypreclinical data from experimental model systems to the development of new mechanistically orientedtherapies in human patients.,447396

Characterized as an infantile-onset epilepsy that leads to severe autistic-like cognitiveimpairment with high rates of sudden unexplained death (SUDEP) DS is caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in SCN1A encoding the type 1 voltage-gated sodium channel. Although a mechanistic basisof the syndrome remains poorly understood studies using animal models strongly suggest that Scn1a mutationsselectively impair PV and SST inhibitory interneurons and conditional deletion of Scn1a in forebrain interneuronswas previously shown to fully recapitulate the epileptic phenotype. This selective impairment of interneuronsmakes DS a promising target for the development of therapy based on transplantation of exogenousinterneurons which can migrate long distances from the injection site and integrate synaptically with surroundingcortical interneurons (INs) within host brain. This unique ability has driven the successful use of interneuronsderived from fetal tissue to treat acquired epilepsy in rodent models. However it remains unclear whether arodent model of a genetic epilepsy can be treated effectively with interneurons that are derived from stem cellsa more clinically applicable viable alternative to fetal cells. Additionally while the physiological roles ofendogenous PV and SST cells are relatively well established it remains unknown how engrafted PV- and SST-fated precursors mature and influence host activity. To address these important questions we will study theeffect of transplants at the level of single cells circuits and whole animals. We hypothesize that mouseembryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived interneuron transplants will synaptically integrate into the epilepticbrain of DS mice improve circuit-level disinhibition in vitro and suppress seizures in vivo. In aim 1 I willuse whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute brain slices to determine whether transplanted PV andSST interneuron transplants demonstrate intrinsic maturity and influence host activity at the level of interneuronsubtype-specific microcircuits. In aim 2 I will assess the inhibitory influence of transplants in vivo by first usingoptogenetics and calcium imaging to assess inhibition of endogenous excitatory neurons and then assessingthe transplants effect on seizures in DS mice.,33101

The long term goal is to clarify mechanisms bywhich specific synaptic dysfunctions trigger neurological disorders. The objective in this application is to determine how mutations in Munc18-1 cause neuronal defects and to identify rescue strategies to reverse suchdeficits. Munc18-1 (also called STXBP1 SEC1 in yeast Rop in flies and unc18 in worms) controls neurotransmitter release at the synapse via binding to multiple effector proteins. Over 30 heterozygous de novo mu-tations have been identified in the Munc18-1 gene that cause the infantile epileptic encephalopathies Ohtahara West and Dravet syndrome but it is unknown how these mutations affect neurons and trigger three different diseases. The central hypothesis based on strong preliminary data is that mutations in Munc18-1 result indefects in its folding stability and localization and elicit same defects in wild-type Munc18-1. This loss of functional Munc18-1 subsequently impairs the function of its effectors and triggers synaptic dysfunction which canbe restored by stabilizing Munc18-1. The rationale for these studies is that understanding of how mutations inMunc18-1 trigger synaptic dysfunction in infantile epileptic encephalopathies will create opportunities for thedevelopment of novel therapies beyond the current limited symptom-based therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data this hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of disease-relevantmutations in Munc18-1 on protein stability; 2) Determine how Munc18-1 mutants affect the stability of its effectors and synapse function; and 3) Identify rescue strategies to stabilize Munc18-1 and restore its function. Under the first aim stability folding aggregation and intracellular targeting will be quantified for Munc18-1 wild-type and mutants combining purified recombinant proteins and primary neurons with biochemical and cell biological techniques. Under the second aim stability interaction and targeting of Munc18-1's effectors syntaxin-1 Doc2 Mint1 Mint2 and rab3 as well as synapse integrity and function will be analyzed using purified proteins primary neurons and in vivo mouse and worm models. Under the third aim chemical and molecularchaperones will be employed to restore deficits in Munc18-1 and in synapse structure and function usingsame paradigms as for aims 1 and 2. This research is significant because it will clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying Munc18-1-linked epilepsies and will have translational importance in the development of newrational treatments. This research is innovative because it 1) tests the novel hypothesis that Munc18-1 mutations cause synaptic dysfunction via a dominant-negative mechanism 2) uses a multidisciplinary and systematic approach that has not previously been used in this research area 3) is technically innovative because ofnewly generated C. elegans strains and 4) shifts focus from a symptom-centered perspective to an approachthat focusses on understanding convergent underlying disease mechanisms that pivot on Munc18-1.,366455

Increased serotonin (5-HT) levels in the brain reduce seizure-induced respiratory arrest in provoked seizure models. However it is unclear whether enhancing 5-HT neuro-transmission exerts protective effects on seizure-induced sudden death in spontaneous seizure (epilepsy)models and which 5-HT circuitry is involved in this sudden death in both provoked and spontaneous seizuremodels. These gaps in knowledge have significantly hindered the therapeutics to prevent SUDEP in patients.The long-term goal is to foster effective prevention strategies against SUDEP using approaches targeted tospecific SUDEP mechanisms. The overall objectives of this proposal are to (1) determine the efficacy of 5-HT-enhancing agents in suppressing seizure-induced sudden death and (2) elucidate the involved 5-HT circuitrymechanisms in animal models especially in a widely-used mouse model of human Dravet syndrome (a type ofepilepsy) that displays spontaneous seizures with a high rate of seizure-induced sudden death. The centralhypothesis is that enhanced 5-HT signaling prevents seizure-induced sudden death and that the 5-HT raphe-amygdala circuitry is involved in this sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. The rationale for this proposal isthat a determination of preclinical therapeutic efficacy of 5-HT-enhancing agents and 5-HT neuronal circuitrymechanisms in seizure-induced sudden death is likely to offer a strong scientific framework by which newstrategies against human SUDEP can be developed. The central hypothesis will be tested in the following twospecific aims: 1) Determine the protective effects of enhancing 5-HT neurotransmission on seizure-inducedsudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice; and 2) Elucidate how 5-HT circuitry from raphe nuclei to the amygda-la modifies seizure-induced sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. We will employ a combination of simul-taneous video EEG/ECG/plethysmography monitoring electrophysiology pharmacology and cell-type specifictechnologies (optogenetics and DREADDs) to perform the work in these aims. The proposed research is inno-vative because it defines a novel 5-HT circuitry mechanism of seizure-induced sudden death using optogenet-ics and DREADDs in animal models especially in a human disease model which could conceptually advancethe knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms of SUDEP. The proposed work is significant becausethe expected outcomes will potentially foster targeted pharmacologic and neurostimulatory interventions ofSUDEP to save lives of at-risk patients.,372916

Nav1.6 is concentrated at the axon initial segment and nodes ofRanvier. Mutations of SCN8A affect many aspects of brain and peripheral nerve function. In 2012 wedescribed the first mutation of SCN8A in a child with early onset epileptic encephalopathy. Since then morethan 150 de novo missense mutations have been identified in this severe form of epilepsy (OMIM # 614558).Our functional characterization of 10 patient mutations demonstrated that gain-of-function mutations resultingin channel hyperactivity are the major pathogenic mechanism underlying SCN8A encephalopathy. Wegenerated a mouse model of the first identified SCN8A mutation p.Asn1768Asp that is widely used forevaluation of therapeutic interventions. We will use this model to isolate a recently discovered genetic modifierthat results in complete rescue of seizures and sudden death. We will also assess the pre-clinicaleffectiveness of antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi reagents that suppress the expression of the dominantSCN8A mutation in the N1768D mouse model. To explore the basis for the severe hypotonia associated withmany SCN8A mutations we have generated a new conditional mouse model with CRE-dependent expressionof the more severe patient mutation p.Arg1872Trp. We will use this new model to examine the role of mutantNav1.6 in specific subsets of neurons at varying stages of development. This conditional model will also beused to directly test the contribution of cardiac expression of hyperactive Nav1.6 to the risk of sudden death.These studies will provide new knowledge regarding pathogenic mechanisms underlying SCN8Aencephalopathy and will test the effectiveness of gene suppression as a therapeutic intervention for thissevere neurological disorder.,509138

Our recent investigation of zebrafish mutants featuring a loss-of-function sodium channel (scn1a)mutation (e.g. a gene mutation identified in ~80% of DS patients) focused on drug discovery anddevelopment metabolic dysfunction and behavioral comorbidities. Using a high-throughput phenotype-basedscreening strategy and medicinal chemistry we screened nearly 3000 drugs successfully identified aserotonin (5HT) receptor mechanism underlying anti-seizure activity of clemizole and developed three novelclemizole analogs. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology we generated new zebrafish mutant linesfor chd2 gabrb3 pcdh19 and stxbp1 (e.g. de novo mutations seen in ~20% of DS patients). Interestinglystxbp1 and gabrb3 mutants exhibit epileptic phenotypes. We also designed and manufactured a microfluidicmulti-channel electrode-integrated platform for long-term non-invasive electrophysiology on larval zebrafish(Hong et al. 2016) and developed a calcium imaging-analysis pipeline for studying seizure macro- and micro-networks in vivo (Liu and Baraban 2019). The proposed work will leverage these unique tools. Three specificaims are proposed: (i) to resolve neural networks responsible for seizures in larval DS zebrafish (ii) to performhigh-throughput drug screening using zebrafish and (iii) to further evaluate clemizole and related anti-seizurecompounds. Techniques will include automated locomotion tracking in vivo zebrafish electrophysiologypharmacology and fast calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium- and voltage-sensitive indicators.Our results promise to simultaneously advance our long-term goals (i) to better understand thepathophysiology of genetic epilepsies and (ii) identify promising new treatment options for these intractableconditions.,510261

Animalmodels are increasingly used to understand disease mechanisms and to screen promising therapeuticapproaches. Animal epilepsy model use typically requires expensive and labor-intensive experimentation withinvasive EEG measurements being the preferred method of validation. This severely limits the pace and scale ofinvestigation. In models of acquired epilepsy animals usually undergo treatment to induce status epilepticusa period of unremitting seizurefollowed by a latent period during which the brain rewires itself to generatespontaneously recurring seizures the hallmark of chronic epilepsy. The duration of the latent period and thelikelihood that an animal will develop epilepsy are both uncertain. Animals must be observed for weeks toconfirm epilepsy before they are ready for experimentation. During this latent period seizures are commonlydocumented by visual observation or video review which are tedious and prone to error. A commercial systemfor automated noninvasive seizure detection would therefore be invaluable to epilepsy researchers.Signal Solutions LLC has developed piezoelectric sensor technologies for noninvasive high-throughputbehavioral monitoring in rodents. This is being used by sleep/circadian researchers around the world anddiscriminates sleep from wakefulness with >90% accuracy. The Sunderam Lab at the University of Kentuckyhas further demonstrated that these piezo sensors can distinguish REM and NREM stages of sleep in mice.To address the needs of epilepsy researchers we performed a Phase I STTR study to: 1. Test the feasibility ofepilepsy onset detection in rodents using noninvasive piezo film sensors; 2. Validate piezo detections againstsimultaneous EEG recordings in rodents with epilepsy; and 3. Test the feasibility of using smaller profile piezosensors and an infrared imager for seizure screening and verification. The study successfully confirmed thefeasibility of these aims.In this Phase II STTR proposal we will further develop methods for accurate noninvasive seizure screening inrodent models through the following objectives: 1. Develop algorithms for detection of both overt and subtleseizures using small form factor piezo sensors; 2. Send a prototype system out for beta testing on differentanimal models and refine the system based on feedback; 3. Develop and validate novel sensor configurationsalgorithms for accurate seizure detection and attribution in group-housed epileptic animals.The envisioned product is a turnkey system for convenient noninvasive seizure screening in small animalmodels of epilepsy in custom or commercial cages that minimizes the need for invasive and resource-intensiveEEG analysis. Potential customers include academic research labs as well as labs in the pharmaceutical sectorengaged in high-volume screening of antiepileptic drugs.,852320

SUDEPmechanisms are not understood although there is evidence to implicate apnea autonomic dysfunction andcardiac arrhythmias. We will take advantage of recent progress in the understanding of SUDEP risk in the geneticepilepsies to investigate the role of cardiac arrhythmias. SUDEP risk varies in a gene-specific manner. Loss-of-function variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) genes SCN1A or SCN1B are identified inpatients with Dravet syndrome (DS) and gain-of-function variants in the VGSC SCN8A are found in patients withEarly Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 13 (EIEE13). DS and EIEE13 patients have the highest SUDEP risk upto 20%. In contrast variants in chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) are also associated withearly onset EE but SUDEP has not been reported in this population. SCN1A- SCN1B- SCN8A- and CHD2-linked epilepsies are developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) severe childhood epilepsiesassociated with cognitive and behavioral impairments. The familial focal epilepsies are attributed to pathogenicvariants in DEPDC5 encoding a member of the GATOR complex in the mTOR pathway. SUDEP is reported in10% of these patients. Because VGSC genes are expressed in both heart and brain we have proposed thatcardiac arrhythmias contribute to the mechanism of SUDEP in channelopathy-linked genetic epilepsies. Ouroverall goal is to understand the mechanisms of SUDEP in the genetic epilepsies. Our objectives are to usepatient-derived or transgenic mouse cardiac myocytes (CMs) to understand how epileptic VGSC gene mutationsalter CM function and arrhythmogenic potential and to determine whether similar changes are found in non-ionchannel epilepsy genes that are expressed in the heart. Our central hypothesis is that both ion channel and non-ion channel genetic epilepsies with high but not low SUDEP risk exhibit pro-arrhythmogenic changes in patient-derived CMs and mouse models. To ask whether abnormal CM excitability also occurs in a non-ion channelgenetic epilepsy with high SUDEP risk we will investigate DEPDC5 variant iPSC-CMs and Depdc5-/- mice.Finally we will examine Chd2-/- mice and human iPSC-CMs with variants in CHD2 a non-ion channel gene witha low SUDEP risk to test whether altered CM excitability is specific to genetic epilepsies with high SUDEP rates.Like the VGSCs DEPDC5 and CHD2 are expressed in brain and heart. Our Specific Aims are: 1. To determinethe effects of SCN1A SCN1B and SCN8A epilepsy variants on CM excitability using patient-derived iPSC-CMs.2. To ascertain whether CMs from DEPDC5 patients or Depdc5+/- mice display abnormal excitability and whetherDepdc5+/- mice have arrhythmia. 3. To determine whether CMs from CHD2 patients or Chd2+/- mice displayabnormal excitability and whether Chd2+/- mice have arrhythmia. There are no effective therapies for any of thegenetic epilepsies and no reliable biomarkers for SUDEP risk. This work may lead to the discovery of diagnosticbiomarkers for SUDEP risk in the future.,720234

This project is designed to give methe training and experience required towards achievement of this goal.The goal of the project is to investigate the mechanisms of epilepsy and cognitive impairment in Dravetsyndrome. Dravet syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder of childhood defined by epilepsy andautism that is currently without cure or disease-modifying therapy. This syndrome is caused by mutations in thegene SCN1A which codes for the voltage gated sodium channel alpha subunit Nav1.1. Based on work in amouse model of Dravet Syndrome it is hypothesized that GABAergic interneurons  particularly the subsetsmarked by expression of parvalbumin (PV-INs) and somatostatin (SST-INs)  are selectively impaired whileexcitatory glutamatergic neurons are not affected. Interneurons are classically considered to be inhibitory soloss of Nav1.1 in interneurons is thought to cause decreased inhibition in the developing brain with resultingcognitive impairment and epilepsy. However interneurons are incredibly diverse in terms of gene expressionmorphology electrophysiological properties and synaptic connectivity. Interneurons marked by expression ofvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP-INs) constitute a third prominent subset of interneurons that form distinctdisinhibitory circuits by primarily targeting other interneurons and thereby regulate cognitive processingattention and learning functions which are impaired in Dravet Syndrome. However no previous study hasinvestigated whether VIP-INs are impaired in this model. I show preliminary data indicating that VIP-INs doexpress Nav1.1 and have impaired excitability in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome. I hypothesize that thisleads to dysfunction of disinhibitory microcircuits that underlie sensory processing and brain state modulation. InAim1 I use slice electrophysiology immunohistochemistry and pharmacology to show that VIP-INs in factexpress Nav1.1 and are functionally impaired in Dravet syndrome mice. In Aim 2 I will investigate the effect ofVIP interneuron dysfunction on the activity of a specific sensorimotor circuit in Dravet Syndrome mice usingoptogenetics and synaptic physiology. Finally in Aim 3 I will use two-photon calcium imaging to study corticaldynamics that depend on VIP-IN activity in awake behaving DS mice in vivo. Results will implicate VIP-INdysfunction in the pathogenesis of Dravet syndrome and suggest novel avenues for therapy.,33248

SUDEPmechanisms are not understood although there is evidence to implicate apnea autonomic dysfunction andcardiac arrhythmias. The majority of SUDEP patients die during sleep and by definition autopsy findings arelargely unremarkable. Here we will generate a novel animal model of genetic epilepsy to investigate the role ofcardiac arrhythmias in this devastating outcome. Loss-of-function variants in SCN1A are identified in patientswith Dravet syndrome (DS). DS patients have the highest SUDEP risk up to 20%. SCN1A is expressed in boththe heart and brain of humans and mice. Because of this we proposed that cardiac arrhythmias contribute tothe mechanism of SUDEP in DS. We were the first group to show evidence for altered cardiac myocyte (CM)sodium current (INa) density and action potentials (APs) as well as cardiac arrhythmias in mouse models ofSCN1A-linked DS. We were also the first to show that induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived CMs fromDS patients have substrates for arrhythmias. Importantly no single animal or iPSC model can completelyreplicate the human DS phenotype. Because cardiac APs in mice are very different than in humans we usedhuman iPSC-CM models to investigate cell autonomous effects of SCN1A haploinsufficiency to predict cardiacarrhythmias. In spite of our success with iPSC-CMs cells in 2-D culture cannot replicate complex cardiac tissuescardiovascular changes or cardiac autonomic innervation. Thus we propose to add a transgenic rabbit modelto our work because rabbits more closely replicate the human cardiac AP than mice and provide a completeorganismal system with which to work. Adding a rabbit model is critical to our ability to fully understand SUDEPand to develop biomarkers for SUDEP risk in the future. The goal of this application is to develop a rabbit modelof Scn1a-linked DS that can be used to more accurately replicate human cardiac physiology to ultimatelyunderstand the mechanisms of SUDEP in the genetic epilepsies. Using donor funds we generated a NewZealand White (NZW) rabbit Scn1a deletion model using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing techniques. We found thatScn1a-/- rabbits seize and die by postnatal day 11 similar to Scn1a-/- mice physiologically confirming genedeletion. However because DS patients are haploinsufficient for SCN1A it is critical to develop a reliableScn1a+/- rabbit DS model. We propose 3 Aims to characterize our new model: 1. To record EEGs in NZW Scn1a+/-rabbits to determine whether the animals have electrographic seizures. 2. To determine whether hyperthermia-induced seizures in NZW Scn1a+/- rabbits progress to DS-like spontaneous seizures. 3. To determine whetherNZW Scn1a+/- rabbits have cardiac arrhythmia. Accomplishment of this work will establish an important newmodel for use in SUDEP research that can be shared with other investigators and provide critical guidance forthe future generation of other rabbit models of genetic epilepsy.,429000

Overlapping neuronal and cardiac expression patterns of mutantsodium channels are proposed to underlie the pathophysiology of a number of genetic diseases thatexhibit both epileptic and cardiac phenotypes. The risk of sudden death in epilepsy patients is twentyfour times greater than the general population. Despite advances in recent years to understand themechanisms of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) it has remained elusive. Proposedmechanisms of SUDEP have implicated seizure-induced apnea pulmonary edema dysregulation ofcerebral circulation autonomic dysfunction or cardiac arrhythmias. Besides being the powerhouse ofthe cell the mitochondria is responsible for long term ionic balance in the cell and compromisedmitochondrial function may precede cardiac arrhythmias and epileptic events. This project seeks touncover novel mechanisms by which cardiac excitability is altered due to compromised mitochondrialenergetics in Dravet Syndrome (DS) models a form of epilepsy with a high incidence of SUDEP. Mycentral hypothesis is that compromised mitochondrial energetics and ionic homeostasis predisposesDS patients to cardiac arrhythmias seizures and SUDEP-like events. I plan to test this hypothesisthrough the following two specific aims: 1) we will determine if mitochondria play a role in ionichomeostasis in mouse models of DS. This aim will test the hypothesis that DS mice have an impairedability to buffer changes in cytosolic Na+ and Ca2+ during times of stress. Using multiple models we willdetermine the role that the mitochondria plays in long-term cellular ionic balance. 2) We will determineif mitochondrial energetics and the ability to match ATP supply with demand is compromised in DS mice.This aim will test the hypothesis that mitochondrial energetic of DS mice have increased reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) production and a decreased ability match ATP supply with demand. Experiments willinvestigate the ability of mitochondria in our DS mouse models to generate ATP at the whole organisolated cell and organelle level. The significance of this project is that it fills a major void inunderstanding the mechanism of SUDEP in DS and results from the proposed experiments have thepotential to lead to new therapeutic treatments in DS. While this grant focuses on the role of DSmutations due to the high incidence of SUDEP it is our hope that these results may be applicable toother genetic and non-genetic epilepsies that will be the focus of future projects. The proposed studieswill provide valuable insight to the field and may lead to the discovery of several potential therapeutictargets for DS. The mitochondria represent an ideal target to investigate as there is growing interest inthe mitochondrial mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis and novel drugs may soon be available to test inepilepsy models.,394102

Seizure susceptibility in ASD and FXS is higher in children than in adults inferring a criticalneurodevelopmental window. Juvenile Fmr1 knock-out mice useful for the study of FXS and ASD exhibitrobust sensory-evoked audiogenic seizures a phenotype that models sensory hypersensitivity and seizures inindividuals with FXS. New studies show that individuals with FXS and Fmr1 knock-out mice also haveperturbations in electroencephalogram (EEG) activity at rest e.g. increased gamma power in the cortex whichwe reproduced and report here as preliminary data. Thus etiologically-valid Fmr1 knock-out mice exhibit twophenotypes with translational relevance to individuals with FXS. Numerous studies have reported alterations inthe serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT) system in FXS and ASD yet knowledge regarding the impact ofspecific 5-HT receptors (5-HTRs) on FXS phenotypes are conspicuously lacking. We now report data showingthat audiogenic seizures in juvenile Fmr1 knock-out mice are entirely prevented by a novel 5-HTR modulatorwith 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R partial agonist activity. Herein we propose definitive in vivo behavioralpharmacology and EEG experiments together with ex vivo receptor pharmacology experiments tomechanistically probe 5-HT1ARs and 5-HT7Rs as targets that can prevent audiogenic seizures (Aim 1) andcorrect EEG abnormalities (Aim 2) in juvenile Fmr1 knock-out mice. We hypothesize in Aim 1 that selective 5-HT1AR activation or selective 5-HT7R inactivation will attenuate audiogenic seizures and combined 5-HT1ARactivation/5-HT7R inactivation will prevent audiogenic seizures in juvenile Fmr1 knock-out mice. We extend thetest of this hypothesis in Aim 2 testing this pharmacodynamic effect to correct EEG phenotypes e.g. tocorrect abnormally high gamma band power in the auditory cortex and somatosensory cortex of juvenile Fmr1knock-out mice. 5-HT1ARs and 5-HT7Rs are densely expressed in the hippocampus a neural system with alow seizure threshold that is altered in Fmr1 knock-out mice and in individuals with FXS. In Aim 3 selectiveradioligands will be used for saturation binding experiments to evaluate 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R expression in thehippocampus and [35S]GTPS assays will be conducted to determine the function of 5-HT1ARs and 5-HT7Rs inthe hippocampus of juvenile Fmr1 knock-out mice compared to wild-type mice. 5-HT1ARs and 5-HT7Rs coupleto regulate adenylate cyclase activity in opposing ways i.e. 5-HT1ARs stimulate Gi whereas 5-HT7Rsstimulate Gs signaling. Since cAMP is known to be altered in FXS and ASD outcomes from this project willprovide knowledge to build a critical infrastructure regarding the putative impact of 5-HTR regulation of cAMPon translationally-valid FXS and ASD phenotypes. Results will also provide important information regardingwhether 5-HT1ARs and/or 5-HT7Rs are viable pharmacotherapeutic targets for FXS or ASD.,424499

For over a century neuroscientistshave categorized brain cell types by their features including shape position physiology molecules andfunction. Single cell transcriptomics studies are now defining molecular cell types at a resolution not previouslypossible uncovering a taxonomy of hundreds to thousands of brain cell types. These studies have also revealeddramatic differences in molecular signatures of homologous cell types across species showing decisively thatthe difference between mouse and human brain is not simply the total number of neurons. However the functionof each cell class or type in brain circuitry and dysfunction in disease is only beginning to be evaluated. Tocharacterize the roles of human brain cell classes in normal function and disease it is critical that tools bedeveloped to allow genetic access to cell classes in vivo. Such tools would enable precise therapeutic genedelivery to brain cell classes permitting targeted treatment for class-specific etiologies like some epilepsies.Few genetic tools are available to mark and manipulate cell classes and types in non-genetically tractablespecies like human and non-human primate (NHP). Viruses including adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)containing cell class and type selective enhancers can be leveraged to gain genetic access to and drive geneexpression in specific brain cell classes in these species. We have initiated a project through the BRAIN Initiativeto generate and validate reporter AAVs to mark specific cell classes in the mouse cortex in vivo and in humanneocortical tissue ex vivo. Our groups have engineered AAV vectors and optimized capsids to access neuronsand express transgenes in many discrete cell classes and types in mouse and primate. New and improved AAVtools promise to fuel human brain scientific discovery and clinical progress but one impediment has been thecostly and time-consuming process of validating new vectors in primates.We present three Aims to translate these promising new AAV vectors into a high-value set of primate-optimizedtools that could eventually be used for gene therapies in humans. First we will develop a platform for screeningAAV vectors in NHP ex vivo brain slices followed by individual validation of promising vectors in NHP in vivoand human ex vivo brain slice cultures. Second we will identify optimal AAV capsids to: a) support widespreadNHP neuronal transduction in vivo when applied intravenously or to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) two preferredroutes of delivery for human CNS gene therapy and b) support AAV transduction of human primary brain tissueex vivo. Third we will perform proof-of-concept experiments using cell class-selective vectors to express atherapeutic transgene in defined classes to treat a severe and intractable form of childhood epilepsy calledDravet syndrome (DS). These experiments represent a significant step towards converting cell class-selectiveAAVs into first-in-class viral tools optimized for in vivo NHP brain studies and human gene therapy applications.,1256184

NaV1.6 is not only expressed in excitatoryneurons where it is critically involved in action potential (AP) generation and propagation but it is alsoexpressed in inhibitory interneurons. Although they make up the minority (~15%) of cortical neurons inhibitoryinterneurons in the neocortex powerfully sculpt network dynamics through various feed-forward feed-backand lateral inhibition circuit motifs. Previous work has implicated NaV1.6 dysfunction with abnormal excitabilityin excitatory neurons driven primarily by persistent and resurgent sodium currents. However there have beenno studies examining the effect of mutant NaV1.6 expression on inhibitory interneuron physiology and thesubsequent contribution of these interneurons to behavioral seizures in SCN8A encephalopathy. This proposalseeks to test the hypothesis that inhibitory interneuron excitability is reduced in the Scn8aD/+ mouse model ofSCN8A encephalopathy leading to an increase in overall network excitability. My preliminary data suggest thatsomatostatin-positive inhibitory interneurons (SST) have reduced intrinsic excitability at high-firing frequenciesdue to entry into depolarization block and have aberrantly large persistent sodium currents. In aim 1 I willrecord WT and Scn8aD/+ and fully characterize the voltage-gated sodium currents intrinsic excitability andalterations in synaptic physiology of the two major interneuron subpopulations: parvalbumin (PV) - andsomatostatin (SST) -positive inhibitory interneurons. This aim will clarify the impact of a gain-of-functionSCN8A mutation on interneuron function and network excitability. In aim 2 I will test the hypothesis thatgenetic knock-down of SCN8A specifically in inhibitory interneuron populations using a Cre-dependent shRNAwill rescue the reduction in interneuron excitability normalize the aberrant sodium channel physiology andhave an impact on seizure frequency and severity in Scn8aD/+ mice. Overall completion of these aims willresolve an important question in the field regarding how interneurons contribute to SCN8A encephalopathy andhopefully generate novel mechanistically-informed approaches to better treat SCN8A encephalopathy.,27167

AMP deaminase (AMPD) deficiency: In collaboration with K. Nagaraju (Children's National Medical Center) the ADST laboratory is developing a coincidence reporter assay to aid in the discovery of compounds that increase expression of the enzyme AMP deaminase implicated in the disease idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM).  IIM is a rare autoimmune progressive disease that afflicts the skeletal muscle of patients.  IIM is comprised of errors in both immune regulation and intrinsic muscle metabolism.  AMP deaminase (AMPD) catalyzes the deamination of AMP to IMP.  In humans AMPD activity is encoded by at least three genes. AMPD isoforms have tissue specific expression patterns in adults and stage specific expression patterns during the muscle development.  Drugs which stimulate the expression of AMPD1 are hypothesized to reverse muscle weakness. Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA):  In collaboration with D. Bodine (NHGRI NIH) and G. Thomas (U. Cincinnati) the ADST laboratory is developing assay strategies as part of a translational research project for DBA a rare congenital disease seen in all ethnic groups with a frequency of  7 cases per million live births. The diagnosis is usually made in the 1st yr. of life as a severe anemia that requires transfusion. Unlike other anemias DBA patients have no reticulocytes in peripheral blood indicating a failure of erythropoiesis whereas production of the white cells and platelets are unaffected.  For a small minority of patients bone marrow transplantation from a healthy sibling is a curative therapy.  For patients without a suitable donor a variety of palliative therapies that can prolong life into the third decade.  Current treatments include corticosteroid therapy which results in reduced growth and other complications or lifelong transfusion and iron chelation.Discovery of Drugs for inherited rare blinding retinal degenerations:  D.

Together they are utilizing ADSTs expertise in assay development chemical biology and quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) to develop assays and chemical library testing paradigms to identify drugs and compounds that have the potential to save and restore vision for people affected by devastating retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration the leading cause of blindness in Americans over 50 years of age. The use of primary rodent retinal cells a limiting cell type for typical HTS experiments benefits from the low-volume assay technology employed in the Inglese laboratory at NCATS. Glucose-regulating multienzyme compartment high throughput quantitative microscopy-based assay.   In collaboration with S. An (UMBC) the ADST laboratory of NCATS is developing a 1536-well plate format high throughput quantitative microscopy-based assay for discovery of compounds that modulate the formation of a dynamically assembled multienzyme complex regulating glucose-derived carbon flux in cells.  Given that glucose metabolism is the central metabolic pathway that balances the cellular needs for both energy and building blocks the pilot screening of pharmacologically active small molecules for or against the assembly will assist to understand the biological significance of the assembly in the cell. In turn extensive high throughput screening is anticipated to discover novel pharmacophores which promote or disrupt the assembly in human disease models for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of glucose metabolism-associated human diseases. Assays for the identification of small molecules up-regulating SCN1A gene expression.  Dravet syndrome a severe epileptic disorder is caused by nonsense mutations in the SCN1A gene resulting in a non-functional protein. In collaboration with V. Broccoli (Institute of Neuroscience Milan) we are developing mouse ES cells capable of differentiation to neurons containing a coincidence reporter biocircuit edited into the genetic locus encoding the alpha subunit of the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel.  Small molecules that up-regulate the unaffected allele of SCN1A may provide a compensatory mechanism for disease treatment.    Controlling cellular senescence with small molecule compounds modulating the 133p53 isoform:  In collaboration with C. Harris (NCI) the ADST laboratory of NCATS is developing a 1536-well plate format high throughput laser-cytometry based assay for discovery of compounds that modulate the cellular distribution and half-life of a specific p53 isoform in cells.  The demonstrated functional and regulatory role served by 133p53 between cellular senescence and autophagy is relevant to both aging and cancer.  Compounds effective in modulating cellular phenotypes based on expression of a GFP- 133p53 sensor will be explored for their pharmacological effect in relevant aging and cancer model systems.Assays for the identification of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) modulators: Genetic mutations resulting in premature stop codon-containing mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) quality control. In situations where residual function of a truncated gene product could mitigate a pathophysiologic phenotype NMD suppression may provide a therapeutic strategy.  Based on our prior NMD assay used in gene-silencing studies (Baird TD et al. 2018) we have developed an NMD-sensitive loss-of-function gain-of-signal assay using our coincidence-reporter technology to examine chemical libraries for discovery of novel NMD-modulating chemotypes. In collaboration with J. R. Hogg (NHLBI NIH) we plan to develop secondary phenotypic assays to measure the impact of modulating NMD in the context of allele-specific disease gene mutations.Inhibition of gametogenic genes in S. pombe as a model for Uniparental Disomy:  Uniparental disomy (UPD) is a chromosomal abnormality where an individual inherits a pair of homologous chromosomes originating from only one parent and is often linked to cancer and other congenital disorders.  Gametogenesis in fission yeast has been used as a model system for defects in the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery of higher organisms.  Working with S. Grewal (NCI NIH) the ADST laboratory is reengineering a medium throughput yeast assay to a higher throughput system capable of qHTS for the evaluation of a large-scale chemical libraries.  Novel sources of chemical libraries evaluated by model organisms of infectious disease:  To probe the biological activity of academias diversity of synthetic chemistry methodology-enabled libraries privileged-chemotype collections isolated natural products (NPs) and pre-fractionated culturable NP extracts (NPEs) the ADST laboratory is testing the anti-infective and anti-parasitic potential of these chemical repositories in model organism microbes and parasites.  Based on either well-established or novel designs these infectious disease assays are complementarily configured to our quantitative,445362

Uncontrolled tonic-clonic seizures place patients at high riskof sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) a major cause of mortality in patients withdrug-resistant epilepsy. The high-fat very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (KDs) help somepatients with uncontrolled epilepsy especially children but have been described as unpalatableand are often not tolerated by patients leading to high rates of non-compliance.We have obtained preliminary data from a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome (DS) a devastatingchildhood-onset epilepsy with refractory seizures and a high incidence of SUDEP and foundseizure-induced death is greatly reduced by supplementing their diet with milk whey (WD). ThisWD was just as protective as two different KDs but did not require an increase in ketone bodies.Moreover our preliminary studies suggest that a WD and KDs increase 5-HT levels and 5-HTrelease in the brain of mice. This is important as 5-HT is known to inhibit seizures and also playsa critical role in control of breathing. Defects in the 5-HT system have been linked to bothrespiratory dysfunction and SUDEP. In this proposed project we will test the hypotheses that 1)whey prevents seizure-induced death by reducing seizure frequency and/or stimulating postictalbreathing via increased brain 5-HT and 2) whey prevents postictal death by reversing the basicunderlying defect in DS mice which is thought to be a decrease in excitability of GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. To determine how a WD affects seizures breathing and neurochemistrywe will use video-EEG/EKG to evaluate the anticonvulsant effects of a WD on spontaneous andhyperthermia-induced seizures and in vivo microdialysis with high performance liquidchromatography to measure extracellular 5-HT in the amygdala a region implicated in seizurepropagation and postictal apnea. We will perform patch clamp recordings on hippocampal brainslices from WD-fed DS mice to evaluate intrinsic electrophysiological properties of interneuronsand pyramidal neurons and will determine if changes in excitability due to the WD are mediatedby increased 5-HT signaling. These studies will provide preclinical data that may guide futureclinical trials to evaluate milk whey supplementation as a safe and healthy dietary therapy fordrug-resistant epilepsy that is more palatable and effective than the KD. These experiments mayalso lead to new avenues of treatment targeted at the serotonergic mechanisms engaged by milkwhey.,42372

Dravet syndrome (DS) acatastrophic childhood epilepsy associated with de novo mutations in a voltage-activated sodiumchannel Nav1.1 is one of the most common genetic epilepsies. DS patients suffer with intractableearly-life seizures and debilitating comorbidities. Energy metabolism in comorbidities associatedwith DS remain virtually unexplored. To address this unmet need recent collaborative researchin our two laboratories revealed decreased glycolytic and oxygen consumption rates in a validatedzebrafish model of DS i.e. scn1Lab mutants. This was accompanied by downregulation of keyenzymes pck1 and pck2 in the gluconeogenesis pathway. Here we hypothesize that energydisruption occurs in DS due to glucose dysregulation resulting in seizures and/or comorbidities.The following aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine if pharmacologicalinhibition of pck1 and/or pck2 phenocopies metabolic and behavioral deficits in wildtype zebrafish.Aim 2 will determine if pharmacological manipulation of pck1 and/or pck2 is therapeutic inscn1Lab mutant zebrafish. These studies promise to provide a mechanistic explanation of themetabolic defects observed in DS and could suggest novel avenues for therapeutic intervention.,504392

About 30% of patients donot respond to current therapies. Thus a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive the disease arerequired. By analyzing the expression level of every gene in the rat hippocampus in 3 different epilepsymodels in 11 institutions and 3 time points after seizure induction we have found a core driver of long termgene changes in the epileptic brain. This complex is called Polycomb. This project will study the role ofPolycomb in the progression of epilepsy.,NINDS,9986046,5/19/2020 0:00,PA-18-484,5R01NS108756-02,5,R01,NS,108756,2, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",8/1/2019 0:00,5/31/2024 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BDCN-E(02)M], ,7052279,"ROOPRA, AVTAR S","DINGLEDINE, RAYMOND J",2,NEUROSCIENCES,161202122,LCLSJAGTNZQ7,161202122,LCLSJAGTNZQ7,US,43.068519,-89.400858,578503,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,MADISON,WI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,537151218,UNITED STATES,N,6/1/2020 0:00,5/31/2021 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2020,504791, ,NINDS,402602,102189, ,Project Summary/Abstract Epilepsy is the 4th most prevalent neurological disorder after stroke Alzheimers and migraine with anincidence of 1 in 26 individuals. Though there are a number of anti-convulsant drugs available there are noanti-epileptogenic drugs that mitigate the progression of the disease. Using novel bioinformatic approacheswe have identified an endogenous protective program launched by the brain after a prolonged seizure thatfunctions to mitigate pathological changes. Epileptogenesis is associated with a plethora of changes in the brain including alterations in plasticitycell death neurogenesis inflammation and axonal sprouting. These changes occur over timescales rangingfrom many minutes to years but the orchestrating mechanisms are virtually unknown. Long-term changes ingene expression that are associated with epileptogenesis imply that one or more master regulators oftranscription may be coordinating the brain alterations. In order to uncover these transcriptional mechanismswe turned to our recently published genome-wide expression datasets generated by the Epilepsy MicroarrayConsortium (EMC). The datasets consist of mRNA expression profiles of rat dentate granule cells assayed atvarious time points after Status Epilepticus (SE). Using a novel bioinformatic tool that integrates wholegenome transcription factor binding data with gene expression profiles we analyzed datasets derived frombrains induced by 3 different convulsant stimuli each in 2 independent labs and at various time-points. Thisanalysis projected that Polycomb target genes represent the majority of chronically altered genes duringepileptogenesis. REST targets represent a second overlapping group of repressed genes. Polycomb is awell-known driver of life-long changes in gene expression that works by epigenetically silencing genes acrossthe phyla. Our data shows an extremely robust induction of EZH2 protein (the catalytic methylase subunit ofPolycomb) over a 20 day window post SE in neurons. Further we find that antagonizing EZH2 shortly afterSE robustly accelerates the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice suggesting a protective ratherthan pathological role for EZH2. How antagonism of EZH2 later after SE remains to be determined. In this project we will test the hypothesis that an alteration in Polycomb output is a principal modifier ofepileptogenesis. We will ascertain whether EZH2 upregulation is always protective or whether its role evolvesduring the latent period. We will test the effect of an order-of-magnitude change in EZH2 levels on corepressorfunction to see whether such upregulation augments or hampers the repressive abilities of two major EZH2containing complexes: Polycomb and REST. We anticipate that these studies will establish Polycomb asa major orchestrator of the long-term changes associated with epileptogenesis. If so approaches thatmodulate Polycomb function may be of benefit to the 65 million people world-wide that live withepilepsy.,504791

Mutations in SCN1Aencoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 are the most common genetic cause of epilepsy.Over 1600 SCN1A mutations have been reported in individuals with epilepsy of varying severity ranging frommild febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome a severe infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy caused byheterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Dravet syndrome is characterized by a variety of seizure typesdevelopmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variableexpressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by geneticmodifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) recapitulate core features of Dravet syndromephenotypes including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reducedsodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons resulting in failure of inhibition and excitatory/inhibitoryimbalance in the brain. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is strongly dependent on strain background. Scn1a+/-mice on the resistant 129 strain (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrastScn1a+/- mice on a [129xB6]F1 strain (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality with50% dying by 1 month of age. Strain-dependent differences are also evident at the level of neuron subtypes.GABAergic interneurons isolated from the susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased sodium current densitycompared to wildtype littermates while sodium current density is preserved in interneurons isolated from129.Scn1a+/- relative to wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for theloss of Nav1.1 while F1 interneurons do not. Based on the strain-dependent difference in phenotypes at thewhole animal and cellular levels we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severitydue to differences in compensatory capacity among neuronal subtypes in the context of Scn1a heterozygousdeletion. We previously mapped several Dravet survival modifier (Dsm) loci that influence premature lethality ofScn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal we will address our hypothesis in three aims. First we will perform finemapping and candidate gene analysis at two Dsm loci on mouse chromosomes 7 and 8. Second we will performsingle cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize differences in cell composition and gene expression in specific cellsubpopulations during the critical phase of phenotype onset in epilepsy susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant129.Scn1a+/- mice. Third we will evaluate the modifier potential of candidate genes in vivo using transcriptionalmodulation to up- and down-regulate candidate gene expression. Results from these studies will identify modifiergenes and pathways that influence phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Identification of modifier genes thatinfluence severity of Dravet syndrome will provide insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and will suggestnovel therapeutic approaches for improved treatment of human patients.,516175

Synaptic integration and plasticity are the cellular mechanisms of information pro-cessing learning and memory. How these fundamental processes are disrupted in epilepsy is not understood.Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus/Dravet syndrome (GEFS+/DS) is a spectrum of epilepsy disor-ders linked to mutations of the SCN1B gene which cause seizures neurodevelopmental delays and early death.To develop treatments for seizures/cognitive deficits of GEFS+/DS epilepsies there is a critical need to identifymechanisms by which SCN1B mutations disrupt cellular-level information processing and learning. Our long-term goal is to define general principles linking genes to disrupted synaptic integration and plasticity in suchneurodevelopmental disorders. The overall objective of our proposal is to define how the interplay between syn-apses dendritic physiology and somatic physiology impair synaptic integration and plasticity in the Scn1b knock-out (KO) mouse model of GEFS+/DS. Our central hypothesis is loss of Scn1b dysregulates ion channels anddendrite excitability disturbing integration and plasticity. To test this hypothesis we will complete three Aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms of somatic and dendritic hyperexcitability in Scn1b KO neurons.Based on preliminary data our hypothesis is that both dendrites and somata of Scn1b KO CA1 pyramidal neu-rons exhibit intrinsic hyperexcitability in part due to abnormal HCN channel activity. We will test this hypothesiswith whole cell somatic and dendritic recordings immunohistochemistry and cell morphology analyses. Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms of altered synaptic integration in Scn1b KO neurons. Based on ourpreliminary data our hypothesis is that loss of Scn1b fundamentally alters the translation of inputs into outputswith both temporal and spatial synaptic integration abnormally enhanced due to dendritic hyperexcitability anddisrupted synaptic physiology. We will use whole cell recordings to test how temporal and spatial features ofinput/output functions are altered in Scn1b KO neurons in response to naturalistic patterns of synaptic inputs. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that Scn1b disruption alters synaptic learning rules and gating by GABAthat dictate plasticity. Based on our preliminary data our hypothesis is that synaptic learning rules governingLTP and LTD induction are re-shaped due to interplay between suppressed excitation hyperexcitable intrinsicproperties and abnormal gating by aberrant depolarizing inhibition after loss of Scn1b. We will test how inputpatterns that evoke LTP and LTD shift after loss of Scn1b and how inhibition influences this plasticity. Upon successful completion of the proposed research we will have defined detailed mechanisms by whichchanges in neuron intrinsic and synaptic physiology and their interactions re-shape the cellular forms of neuralprocessing and learning in the Scn1b KO mouse model of GEFS+/DS. This contribution will provide mechanisticlinks between genetic changes primary neurophysiology phenotypes and neuronal processing deficits underly-ing seizures and the learning memory and cognition impairments in GEFS+/DS epilepsies.,367775

Clinical and animal studies show that seizure-induced respiratoryarrest is the primary event leading to death. Increased serotonin (5-HT) levels in the brain reduce seizure-induced respiratory arrest in provoked seizure models. However it is unclear whether enhancing 5-HT neuro-transmission exerts protective effects on seizure-induced sudden death in spontaneous seizure (epilepsy)models and which 5-HT circuitry is involved in this sudden death in both provoked and spontaneous seizuremodels. These gaps in knowledge have significantly hindered the therapeutics to prevent SUDEP in patients.The long-term goal is to foster effective prevention strategies against SUDEP using approaches targeted tospecific SUDEP mechanisms. The overall objectives of this proposal are to (1) determine the efficacy of 5-HT-enhancing agents in suppressing seizure-induced sudden death and (2) elucidate the involved 5-HT circuitrymechanisms in animal models especially in a widely-used mouse model of human Dravet syndrome (a type ofepilepsy) that displays spontaneous seizures with a high rate of seizure-induced sudden death. The centralhypothesis is that enhanced 5-HT signaling prevents seizure-induced sudden death and that the 5-HT raphe-amygdala circuitry is involved in this sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. The rationale for this proposal isthat a determination of preclinical therapeutic efficacy of 5-HT-enhancing agents and 5-HT neuronal circuitrymechanisms in seizure-induced sudden death is likely to offer a strong scientific framework by which newstrategies against human SUDEP can be developed. The central hypothesis will be tested in the following twospecific aims: 1) Determine the protective effects of enhancing 5-HT neurotransmission on seizure-inducedsudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice; and 2) Elucidate how 5-HT circuitry from raphe nuclei to the amygda-la modifies seizure-induced sudden death in DBA/1 and Dravet mice. We will employ a combination of simul-taneous video EEG/ECG/plethysmography monitoring electrophysiology pharmacology and cell-type specifictechnologies (optogenetics and DREADDs) to perform the work in these aims. The proposed research is inno-vative because it defines a novel 5-HT circuitry mechanism of seizure-induced sudden death using optogenet-ics and DREADDs in animal models especially in a human disease model which could conceptually advancethe knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms of SUDEP. The proposed work is significant becausethe expected outcomes will potentially foster targeted pharmacologic and neurostimulatory interventions ofSUDEP to save lives of at-risk patients.,370536

Equally devastating intellectual and behavioraldisabilities severely disrupt quality of life for patients and caregivers and have no effective therapy. Classicallyintellectual impairments have been considered a direct effect of uncontrolled seizures and research has beentargeted at improving seizure control. Recent work in systems neurophysiology suggests that specific patternsof brain activity so-called brain rhythms underlie cognition and that disruption of these rhythms impairsintellectual ability. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether loss-of-function mutations inScn1a are sufficient to disrupt SWR and whether spatial memory is impaired in parallel. To determine whetherseizures contribute to spatial memory impairment to determine whether restoration of Scn1a expression withgene therapy recovers normal SWR features and improves spatial memory we will use existing DS mousemodels and generate a novel DS model in which Scn1a expression can be recovered in a previously affectedmouse a genetic `cure'. These findings will provide important insights into cognitive impairment in DS and areessential groundwork for future translational research into cognitive therapies.,NINDS,9928107,8/12/2020 0:00,PAR-14-153,5R01NS094186-05,5,R01,NS,94186,5, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",6/15/2016 0:00,5/31/2021 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-IFCN-Q(55)], ,1952790,"OAKLEY, JOHN C",Not Applicable,7,PHARMACOLOGY,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,6/1/2020 0:00,5/31/2021 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2020,337969, ,NINDS,218750,119219, ,PROJECT SUMMARYCognitive impairment is a frequent comorbidity affecting 75% of people with epilepsy including patients withDravet syndrome (DS) a severe-infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by frequent prolongedseizures and numerous co-morbidities resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the voltage-gated sodiumchannel gene SCN1A. Current drug therapies are ineffective at controlling seizures and no therapy exists forsevere cognitive deficits. While seizure frequency and severity often improves children with DS who surviveinto their teenage years have IQs in the severely impaired range 50 to 70 and typically require permanentinstitutional or family care. Therapy for cognitive impairment would dramatically improve the lives of thesepatients substantially reduce long-term care costs and reduce accidental deaths. Work in genetic mousemodels which are faithful genocopies and phenocopies shows that inhibitory interneuron but not excitatorycell activity is impaired resulting in an in-balance between excitation and inhibition the likely cause of seizuresand co-morbidities. An emerging principle from systems-level neuroscience is that cognition depends onprecisely timed electrophysiologic patterns brain rhythms. Whether disrupted brain rhythms contribute tocognitive impairment in human disease and whether interventions targeted at normalization of rhythmsthrough pharmaceuticals targeted stimulation or via correction of genetic defect are a reasonable therapeuticstrategy remains to be determined. Hippocampal sharp - wave / ripple (SWR) complexes contribute to spatiallearning and memory and require high frequency temporally precise action potential firing in inhibitoryinterneurons. We hypothesize that: Decreased SWR recurrence and slowed intra-ripple frequency arecaused by hippocampal interneuron hypoexcitability and contribute to spatial memory impairment inDS mice. The proposed experiments will: (1) extend the preliminary finding of decreased ripple recurrence andslowed intra-ripple frequency in DS mice comparing SWR features by sleep-wake state and during context-dependent spatial learning to determine if rate of SWR occurrence and intra-ripple frequency are correlatedwith Scn1a expression and memory performance (2) determine whether spatial memory impairment ismediated through effects of reduced Scn1a expression reduced Na current and hypoexcitability of forebrainGABAergic interneurons (3) determine whether seizures contribute to spatial memory impairment and alteredSWR features and (4) determine whether altered SWR features and impaired spatial memory can benormalized with restoration of Na channel expression. This work will be organized around the following specificaims: Aim 1: Dependence of SWR recurrence intra-ripple frequency and spatial memory impairmenton Scn1a expression Aim 2: Contribution of seizures to reduced SWR occurrence slowed intra-ripplefrequency and spatial memory impairment,337969

Mutations in them cause inherited epilepsy migraine chronic pain and periodicparalysis and they are important molecular targets for drugs. A. New insights into structure and function of Navchannels have come from our high-resolution x-ray crystallography of their bacterial ancestor NavAb. We willfurther define the structural basis for key functional properties of mammalian Nav channels by building theircharacteristic structural features into NavAb including the structural basis for voltage-dependent activation ionselectivity and fast inactivation. Based on these results we will determine the structural basis for impaired Navchannel function by mutations that cause periodic paralysis and the chronic pain syndromes erythromelalgiaand paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. B. Failure of learning and memory is a debilitating aspect of aging andneurodegenerative disease yet we do not understand the basic mechanisms of these crucial brain processesand we cannot intervene effectively in these deficits. Learning and memory takes place primarily at synapses.Presynaptic calcium (Cav2.1) channels initiate neurotransmitter release at most synapses in the brain. Theactivity of these channels is tightly regulated by a large complex of signaling proteins including calmodulin andrelated calcium-sensor proteins. Our work implicates Cav2.1 channel regulation in short-term synaptic plasticityin transfected synapses in cultured neurons and in a novel mouse model in which the IM-AA mutation isinserted into Cav2.1. We will further define the molecular and structural mechanism for Cav2.1 channelregulation determine the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels in short-term synaptic plasticity of neuralcircuits and explore the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels and short-term synaptic plasticity in spatiallearning and memory. Our experiments with this unique mouse model will give unique insights into themechanism of short-term presynaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons and its role in integrative bbrainfunction. C.

We developed a mouse genetic model with all the featuresof DS including thermally induced and spontaneous seizures ataxia circadian rhythm and sleep disorderscognitive deficit autistic-like features and premature death via SUDEP. Physiological and genetic studiesshow that all these effects are correlated with loss of Na currents and excitability of GABAergic interneuronswithout consistent effects on excitatory neurons which causes imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neuralcircuits. To further advance understanding of pathophysiology and treatment of DS we will determine theneural cells and circuits responsible for DS using specific deletion by the Cre-Lox method identify the sites ofhyperexcitability in neural cells and circuits that appear first in DS mice in vivo and optimize next-generationcombination therapy for seizures status epilepticus cognitive deficit and premature death in DS.,1111616

Common synthetic strategies require prefunctionalization to introduceheteroatoms and larger functional groups rendering the molecules difficult to handle purify and subject tofurther diversification. Nature approaches such synthetic bottlenecks by constructing simple cores anddecorating scaffolds later on in biosynthesis. Chemists take inspiration from Natures techniques in designinglate-stage CH functionalization routes but the ability of enzymes to generate molecular complexity isunmatched by state-of-the-art synthetic methods. Thus biocatalysis represents a unique approach to tacklingthe synthetic challenges associated with drug design.Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are an untapped source of antiepileptic drug targets. Over 50 naturally derivedPSTs have been identified and the select few that have been assessed for binding to voltage-gated sodiumchannels (VGSCs) have demonstrated the ability to block VGSCs. This molecular response corresponds tophysical responses desired in antiepileptic drug targets. The study of PSTs as antiepileptic drug targets hasbeen hindered by challenging synthetic routes and the inability to isolate sufficient quantities of most of the >50analogs. Gene clusters associated with paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthesis have been identified enablingopportunities to leverage enzymes capable of chemistry inaccessible to even the most skilled chemist. Thisproposal describes strategies to elucidate the paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthetic pathway evaluate enzymesubstrate scopes and isolate novel compounds from biocatalytic reactions for analysis with VGSCs usingelectrophysiological techniques.In summary this work aims to diversify the PST scaffold using PST biosynthetic enzymes from cyanobacteriaenabling chemical transformations on complex heteroatom-rich molecules that are otherwise intractable. Themethods established in this proposal will accelerate the discovery of new antiepileptic drugs by developing newchemical reactions using biocatalysts from the biosynthetic pathway of known VGSC blocking compounds.,11980

Therapy that improves function of defective interneurons is notavailable. Structural development and maintenance of interneurons is dependent on trophic support providedby brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation of TrkB receptors. In the undercut (UC) model ofepileptogenic neocortical injury chronic activation of TrkB-Rs with a selective small molecule partial agonist(LM22A-4 LM below) has long-term effects to reverse structural and functional abnormalities in inhibitoryterminals of PV interneurons enhance GABA release and increase the threshold for evoking epileptiformactivity and seizures. In order to determine whether these effects will be applicable to treatment or preventionof epilepsy in other models with different causes for seizures such as genetic epilepsies the Dravet syndrome(DS) mouse will be used in some experiments. Decreases in a membrane sodium channel in PV interneuronsin DS mice causes decreased release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA and development of spontaneousand high temperature-induced seizures. A variety of experimental approaches in DS and UC mice will be usedto determine whether chronic treatment with LM by increasing GABA release from nerve terminals of SOMand PV interneurons or inducing new inhibitory synapse formation will enhance inhibition in cortical networksand suppress epileptiform discharges: 1) immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging will be used to assessalterations in PV and SOM presynaptic terminals including changes in expression of VGAT- and GAD65/67-IR and the calcium sensor protein synaptotagmin 2; 2) analysis of density of SOM/- and PV/gephyrin closeappositions to test for new inhibitory synapse formation induced by TrkB activation; 3) electrophysiologicalanalysis of basic properties of inhibitory synaptic transmission from PV interneurons to pyramidal neurons of invitro slices to detect effects of TrkB activation on unitary IPSCs release probability and transmission failures;3) laser scanning photostimulation of cortical slices from PV/CHR2 and SOM/CHR2 mice to map thedistribution and strength of inhibitory connectivity in neocortical inhibitory circuits; and 4) video/EEG monitoringof implanted mice to assess effects of treatment with LM on spontaneous seizures and hyperthermia-inducedseizures. Results of these experiments will provide information about mechanisms leading from interneuronalabnormalities to development of epilepsy and a potential approach to prophylaxis of epileptogenesis byenhancing trophic support of interneurons.,344434

Our recent investigation of zebrafish mutants featuring a loss-of-function sodium channel (scn1a)mutation (e.g. a gene mutation identified in ~80% of DS patients) focused on drug discovery anddevelopment metabolic dysfunction and behavioral comorbidities. Using a high-throughput phenotype-basedscreening strategy and medicinal chemistry we screened nearly 3000 drugs successfully identified aserotonin (5HT) receptor mechanism underlying anti-seizure activity of clemizole and developed three novelclemizole analogs. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology we generated new zebrafish mutant linesfor chd2 gabrb3 pcdh19 and stxbp1 (e.g. de novo mutations seen in ~20% of DS patients). Interestinglystxbp1 and gabrb3 mutants exhibit epileptic phenotypes. We also designed and manufactured a microfluidicmulti-channel electrode-integrated platform for long-term non-invasive electrophysiology on larval zebrafish(Hong et al. 2016) and developed a calcium imaging-analysis pipeline for studying seizure macro- and micro-networks in vivo (Liu and Baraban 2019). The proposed work will leverage these unique tools. Three specificaims are proposed: (i) to resolve neural networks responsible for seizures in larval DS zebrafish (ii) to performhigh-throughput drug screening using zebrafish and (iii) to further evaluate clemizole and related anti-seizurecompounds. Techniques will include automated locomotion tracking in vivo zebrafish electrophysiologypharmacology and fast calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium- and voltage-sensitive indicators.Our results promise to simultaneously advance our long-term goals (i) to better understand thepathophysiology of genetic epilepsies and (ii) identify promising new treatment options for these intractableconditions.,485753

NaV1.6 is not only expressed in excitatoryneurons where it is critically involved in action potential (AP) generation and propagation but it is alsoexpressed in inhibitory interneurons. Although they make up the minority (~15%) of cortical neurons inhibitoryinterneurons in the neocortex powerfully sculpt network dynamics through various feed-forward feed-backand lateral inhibition circuit motifs. Previous work has implicated NaV1.6 dysfunction with abnormal excitabilityin excitatory neurons driven primarily by persistent and resurgent sodium currents. However there have beenno studies examining the effect of mutant NaV1.6 expression on inhibitory interneuron physiology and thesubsequent contribution of these interneurons to behavioral seizures in SCN8A encephalopathy. This proposalseeks to test the hypothesis that inhibitory interneuron excitability is reduced in the Scn8aD/+ mouse model ofSCN8A encephalopathy leading to an increase in overall network excitability. My preliminary data suggest thatsomatostatin-positive inhibitory interneurons (SST) have reduced intrinsic excitability at high-firing frequenciesdue to entry into depolarization block and have aberrantly large persistent sodium currents. In aim 1 I willrecord WT and Scn8aD/+ and fully characterize the voltage-gated sodium currents intrinsic excitability andalterations in synaptic physiology of the two major interneuron subpopulations: parvalbumin (PV) - andsomatostatin (SST) -positive inhibitory interneurons. This aim will clarify the impact of a gain-of-functionSCN8A mutation on interneuron function and network excitability. In aim 2 I will test the hypothesis thatgenetic knock-down of SCN8A specifically in inhibitory interneuron populations using a Cre-dependent shRNAwill rescue the reduction in interneuron excitability normalize the aberrant sodium channel physiology andhave an impact on seizure frequency and severity in Scn8aD/+ mice. Overall completion of these aims willresolve an important question in the field regarding how interneurons contribute to SCN8A encephalopathy andhopefully generate novel mechanistically-informed approaches to better treat SCN8A encephalopathy.,33461

Dravet syndrome is caused by mutation in the gene SCN1A which encodes the sodium(Na+) channel Nav1.1 How SCN1A mutation leads to the clinical entity known as Dravet syndromeremains unclear; this gap in knowledge has profoundly limited the practical impact that such a diagnosis hason treatment quality of life and long-term outcome for patients with this disorder.Prior work in experimental animal models of Dravet syndrome including Scn1a+/- mice suggests that loss ofNav1.1 leads to epilepsy via dysfunction of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex with themost prominent identified abnormalities being impaired action potential generation in a critical subtype ofinterneuron known as the parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneuron (PV-IN). However data presented hereindicates that surprisingly PV-IN dysfunction is transient being restricted to a brief time window in earlydevelopment with subsequent recovery of high frequency firing. Preliminary data suggests that the specificlocus of pathology in Dravet syndrome is actually PV-IN axons with abnormal action potential propagationleading to conduction delay and synaptic failure even though PV-INs have recovered the ability to generateaction potentials at high frequency. This finding has important implications for the development of noveltreatment approaches for Dravet syndrome such as cell transplantation gene therapy or precision medicine.This new 5-year application from the lab of an early stage investigator uses innovative neuroscienceapproaches to test this new hypothesis as to the mechanism of pathology in Dravet syndrome. Proposedexperiments will establish the molecular identity and physiological properties of Na+ channels in PV-IN axonsin Scn1a+/- mice as compared to wild-type controls using targeted recordings from interneuron axons anddetailed immunohistochemistry of axonal Na+ channels (Aim 1); determine the impact of PV-IN axonaldysfunction on the timing of feedforward inhibition in cerebral cortical circuits (Aim 2); and assess the activityof defined subsets of neurons in awake behaving Scn1a+/- mice using in vivo imaging and electrophysiologyto corroborate in vitro findings (Aim 3).The overall outcome of the proposed experiments will set forth a unifying hypothesis as to the pathophysiologyof Dravet syndrome. Such knowledge is critical to the development of novel targeted therapies for thiscurrently incurable and untreatable disease. The long-term objective of this line of research is to applypreclinical data from experimental model systems to the development of new mechanistically orientedtherapies in human patients.,442861

This project is designed to give methe training and experience required towards achievement of this goal.The goal of the project is to investigate the mechanisms of epilepsy and cognitive impairment in Dravetsyndrome. Dravet syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder of childhood defined by epilepsy andautism that is currently without cure or disease-modifying therapy. This syndrome is caused by mutations in thegene SCN1A which codes for the voltage gated sodium channel alpha subunit Nav1.1. Based on work in amouse model of Dravet Syndrome it is hypothesized that GABAergic interneurons  particularly the subsetsmarked by expression of parvalbumin (PV-INs) and somatostatin (SST-INs)  are selectively impaired whileexcitatory glutamatergic neurons are not affected. Interneurons are classically considered to be inhibitory soloss of Nav1.1 in interneurons is thought to cause decreased inhibition in the developing brain with resultingcognitive impairment and epilepsy. However interneurons are incredibly diverse in terms of gene expressionmorphology electrophysiological properties and synaptic connectivity. Interneurons marked by expression ofvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP-INs) constitute a third prominent subset of interneurons that form distinctdisinhibitory circuits by primarily targeting other interneurons and thereby regulate cognitive processingattention and learning functions which are impaired in Dravet Syndrome. However no previous study hasinvestigated whether VIP-INs are impaired in this model. I show preliminary data indicating that VIP-INs doexpress Nav1.1 and have impaired excitability in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome. I hypothesize that thisleads to dysfunction of disinhibitory microcircuits that underlie sensory processing and brain state modulation. InAim1 I use slice electrophysiology immunohistochemistry and pharmacology to show that VIP-INs in factexpress Nav1.1 and are functionally impaired in Dravet syndrome mice. In Aim 2 I will investigate the effect ofVIP interneuron dysfunction on the activity of a specific sensorimotor circuit in Dravet Syndrome mice usingoptogenetics and synaptic physiology. Finally in Aim 3 I will use two-photon calcium imaging to study corticaldynamics that depend on VIP-IN activity in awake behaving DS mice in vivo. Results will implicate VIP-INdysfunction in the pathogenesis of Dravet syndrome and suggest novel avenues for therapy.,50016

In addition patients with genetic generalized epilepsy do not have the option of epilepsy surgery. The focus of this project is to explore the cellular and network basis of anti-epileptic drug response in genetic generalized epilepsy. The candidate has a strong clinical background in epilepsy and has developed significant preliminary work which forms the basis for the proposed research. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that interictal relative gamma power (30-100 Hz) may predict anti-epileptic drug response in absence epilepsy and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet Syndrome) due to the effect of these drugs on fast-spiking interneurons. The stargazer and tottering mouse models of epilepsy as well as the Scn1a heterozygous knock-in model of Dravet Syndrome are ideal for studying this hypothesis since they have mutations which have been associated with fast-spiking interneuron deficits and these interneurons are critical for the generation of neocortical gamma rhythms. In addition these models are known to have paradoxical seizure exacerbation with certain anti-epileptic drugs. In this project using in vivo 2-photon microscopy and simultaneous EEG post-hoc immunohistochemistry and in vivo video-EEG monitoring sampling at 2 kHz the specific aims of this project are to: (1) Determine the neocortical cell-specific and local network responses to anti-epileptic drugs in vivo in 3 models of genetic generalized epilepsy and (2) Evaluate the effect of anti-epileptic drugs on interictal EEG power between 2-300 Hz in vivo in the same 3 models of genetic generalized epilepsy. This proposal merges the techniques of computational analysis of EEG previously acquired under the mentorship of Sydney Cash MD PhD and more recent techniques acquired under the ongoing mentorship of Jeffrey Noebels MD PhD (primary mentor) who provides expertise in neurogenesis and Stelios Smirnakis MD PhD (co-mentor) who provides expertise in 2-photon imaging. In the short term the candidate has assembled a gap-based plan for rigorous training and coursework focusing on developing expertise in 2-photon imaging and patch-clamp techniques in vivo statistical modelling and analysis and translational research methodology while also learning about and treating patients with epilepsy in a clinical context. In the long term with a strong institutional commitment and abundant resources available in the Texas Medical Center this training will aid in the candidate's development as an independent clinician- scientist with a unique focus on diminishing pharmacoresistance in patients with epilepsy. Ultimately the completion of this research will shed new light on the mechanisms of genetic generalized epilepsy and can directly lead to improved drug development and patient care.,189832

Ion channel dysfunction is widely believed to form the basis of both inherited and acquired forms of epilepsy. This study will examine possible mechanisms causing dysfunction of the HCN1 ion channel both after acquired insults to the brain and in a recently identified human genetic epilepsy syndrome.,NINDS,9890005,4/1/2020 0:00,PA-13-302,5R01NS050229-13,5,R01,NS,50229,13, ,"CHURN, SEVERN BORDEN",7/1/2005 0:00,3/31/2023 0:00,Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section[CNNT], ,1861785,"POOLOS, NICHOLAS P",Not Applicable,7,NEUROLOGY,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,4/1/2020 0:00,3/31/2023 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2020,337969, ,NINDS,218750,119219, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are voltage-gated ion channels that modulate excitability in several brain regions involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy including the hippocampus neocortex and thalamus. Accumulated evidence shows that downregulation of Ih the current generated by HCN channels causes neuronal hyperexcitability and that genetic deletion of HCN1 channels the main cortical and hippocampal subtype accelerates the rate of epileptogenesis in acquired epilepsy models. More recent evidence shows that mutations in HCN1 underlie early life epileptic encephalopathy in some children with severe epilepsy and developmental delay. Thus HCN1 channelopathy occurs in both human genetic epilepsy and animal models of acquired epilepsy.  In recent work from our laboratory epilepsy induced by chemoconvulsant-induced status epilepticus (SE) was associated with loss of HCN1 channel expression that began within 1 hour post-SE and persisted into chronic epilepsy. HCN1 channels were acutely internalized from the surface membrane of hippocampal pyramidal dendrites within the first hour following SE well before the onset several days later of transcriptional downregulation of HCN1 mRNA expression. We now show for the first time that HCN1 channel surface expression is governed in a bidirectional fashion by protein kinase C (PKC) activity with increased phosphorylation of HCN1 by PKC leading to decreased HCN1 surface expression. New preliminary data using mass spectrometry techniques show that HCN1 channels are minimally phosphorylated at rest but undergo increased phosphorylation at S867 and S868 residues which are also phosphorylated in naive tissue under conditions of PKC activation. These data suggest that the earliest manifestation of HCN1 channels dysfunction during epileptogenesis is PKC-mediated loss of surface expression and concomitant loss of HCN1-mediated current (Ih).  Our goal in this R01 renewal application is to further understand the mechanisms of HCN1 channel dysfunction during the development of epilepsy. We propose to further study the phosphorylation signaling mechanisms underlying acute changes in HCN1 membrane trafficking after SE; determine whether these early events contribute to or initiate chronic HCN1 channelopathy; and characterize the effects of human HCN1 mutations on HCN1 channel biophysical properties. To do so we will use state-of-the-art techniques including: mass spectrometry; viral transduction of mutant HCN1 channel expression in vivo; cellular electrophysiology in the dendrites of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons; and analysis of a novel dataset of HCN1 mutations in a cohort of 800 children affected with epileptic encephalopathy of unknown cause.,337969

The first SCN8A-associated epilepsy mutation was recently identified in2012 and since then an increasing number of de novo SCN8A mutations have been identifiedin patients with severe refractory childhood epilepsy. De novo SCN8A mutations have also beenfound in patients with autism intellectual disability and developmental delay but with less severeepilepsy or no seizures. To better understand the phenotypic spectrum associated with SCN8Adysfunction we generated and characterized a knock-in mouse line expressing the humanSCN8A R1620L mutation which was identified in a patient with autism. Scn8aRL/+ mutants exhibitincreased seizure susceptibility spontaneous seizures and behavioral deficits including socialand cognitive impairment. A major challenge in the treatment of patients with SCN8A-associateddisease is the broad range of clinical presentations. Furthermore in many cases behavioralcomorbidities are not the primary treatment focus and often persist or worsen even if seizurecontrol is obtained. Therefore the goal of this proposal is to use the Scn8aR1620L/+ mutants tothoroughly and systematically compare the ability of 5 different antiepileptic drugs to improve bothseizure and behavioral phenotypes.,429000

Most concerning are the severe seizures and high risk of suddenunexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Mutations in voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC)  and  subunitgenes are linked to DS. While the majority of DS cases are linked to SCN1A haploinsufficiency SCN1Bhomozygous mutations are also linked to DS. Scn1b-/- mice have a DS phenotype with SUDEP. SCN1Bencodes VGSC 1 subunits which are developmentally regulated cell adhesion molecules and ion channelmodulators that play critical roles in the regulation of excitability. Scn1b-/- mice have cell type specific changesin Na+ (INa) and K+ (IK) currents. In addition Scn1b-/- mice have neuronal proliferation migration andpathfinding defects at postnatal day (P)5 that precede seizure onset at ~P10. These data suggested thatalterations in CAM function may contribute to hyperexcitability however new data challenge this idea and offerthe alternative explanation that defective cell adhesion in SCN1B-linked DS may not contribute to seizures butinstead impact other co-morbidities. Preliminary data show that Scn1b-/- mice also have delayed maturation ofneuronal Cl- gradients such that GABAergic signaling remains depolarizing and excitatory until ~P17-18 whichmay contribute to hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The objective of this work is to understand themechanism of hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The central hypothesis is that the mechanism ofhyperexcitability in the Scn1b-/- model of DS is cell type specific changes in INa IK and GABAergic signaling.Further it is proposed that human SCN1B-DS mutations result in loss-of-function with similar defects in ioniccurrents and delayed maturation of GABAergic signaling as observed in Scn1b-/- neurons. The experimentalplan will test three Aims: 1. To determine the mechanism of hyperexcitability resulting from Scn1b deletion; 2.To determine whether human SCN1B-linked DS mutations result in loss-of-function in mouse models; 3. Todetermine the phenotype of SCN1B-linked DS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons.Model choice is key to understanding epilepsy mechanisms. Importantly mice are not small humans. Thuspatient-derived iPSC neuronal models provide essential information regarding human disease. On the otherhand mature brain networks cannot yet be replicated using iPSCs and so brain slice preparations fromtransgenic mouse models remain important to understanding circuitry. Rather than relying on a single modelthis project will compare and contrast human and mouse models to understand key mechanistic aspects of thedevelopment of hyperexcitability in DS. Even though SCN1B-linked DS is rare compared to SCN1A-linkeddisease this work may lead to the discovery of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in DS caused bymultiple types of gene mutations.,653145

We will test the central hypothesis that increased Na+ current expression in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons underlies neuronal hyperexcitability in Dravet Syndrome.

Despite the development of mouse models pathophysiological mechanisms for these disorders are poorly understood. One particularly devastating channelopathy is Dravet Syndrome (DS) a severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy typically caused by de novo dominant mutations in SCN1A encoding the voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) Nav1.1. Heterologous expression of mutant channels suggests haploinsufficiency raising the question of how loss of VGSCs underlying action potentials (APs) produces hyperexcitability. Data from DS mouse models indicate both decreased Na+ current in interneurons implicating disinhibition and increased Na+ current in pyramidal cells implicating hyperexcitability depending on genetic background brain area and animal age. To understand the effects of SCN1A DS mutations in human neurons we derived forebrain-like neurons from two DS subjects by induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming of patient fibroblasts and compared them with iPSC-derived neurons from human controls. We found that DS patient-derived neurons have increased Na+ current density in both bipolar- and pyramidal-shaped neurons. Consistent with increased Na+ current both putative excitatory and inhibitory patient-derived neurons showed spontaneous bursting and other evidence of hyperexcitability. Our data provided some of the first evidence that epilepsy patient-specific neurons obtained via the iPSC method are useful for modeling epileptic-like hyperactivity. Moreover our findings revealed a previously unrecognized potential epilepsy mechanism underlying DS and offered a platform for future screening of novel anti-epileptic therapies using patient-derived neurons. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular basis of genetic epilepsies. Our objective is to determine epilepsy mechanisms of SCN1A-linked DS in humans. We will test the central hypothesis that SCN1A haploinsufficiency leads to paradoxically increased Na+ current in excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as alterations in other ionic currents that underlie neuronal hyperexcitability in DS. The rationale fr this work is that identifying the role of SCN1A haploinsufficiency in the development of hyperexcitability may lead to novel treatments for DS as well as related pediatric epilepsies. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1: To determine whether SCN1A haploinsufficiency causes alterations in the expression of other VGSC -subunits that lead to increased Na+ current in DS patient-specific iPSC neurons. 2: To investigate changes in synaptic function in DS patient-specific iPSC neurons. 3: To determine the electrophysiological characteristics of DS patient-specific and control iPSC neurons differentiated in the rodent brain.This work is expected to reveal how SCN1A haploinsufficiency contributes to epilepsy in humans. Our results will have positive impact because this work will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of DS and related diseases and may lead to novel therapeutic agents for epilepsy.,530204

Nav1.6 is concentrated at the axon initial segment and nodes ofRanvier. Mutations of SCN8A affect many aspects of brain and peripheral nerve function. In 2012 wedescribed the first mutation of SCN8A in a child with early onset epileptic encephalopathy. Since then morethan 150 de novo missense mutations have been identified in this severe form of epilepsy (OMIM # 614558).Our functional characterization of 10 patient mutations demonstrated that gain-of-function mutations resultingin channel hyperactivity are the major pathogenic mechanism underlying SCN8A encephalopathy. Wegenerated a mouse model of the first identified SCN8A mutation p.Asn1768Asp that is widely used forevaluation of therapeutic interventions. We will use this model to isolate a recently discovered genetic modifierthat results in complete rescue of seizures and sudden death. We will also assess the pre-clinicaleffectiveness of antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi reagents that suppress the expression of the dominantSCN8A mutation in the N1768D mouse model. To explore the basis for the severe hypotonia associated withmany SCN8A mutations we have generated a new conditional mouse model with CRE-dependent expressionof the more severe patient mutation p.Arg1872Trp. We will use this new model to examine the role of mutantNav1.6 in specific subsets of neurons at varying stages of development. This conditional model will also beused to directly test the contribution of cardiac expression of hyperactive Nav1.6 to the risk of sudden death.These studies will provide new knowledge regarding pathogenic mechanisms underlying SCN8Aencephalopathy and will test the effectiveness of gene suppression as a therapeutic intervention for thissevere neurological disorder.,509138

The long term goal is to clarify mechanisms bywhich specific synaptic dysfunctions trigger neurological disorders. The objective in this application is to determine how mutations in Munc18-1 cause neuronal defects and to identify rescue strategies to reverse suchdeficits. Munc18-1 (also called STXBP1 SEC1 in yeast Rop in flies and unc18 in worms) controls neurotransmitter release at the synapse via binding to multiple effector proteins. Over 30 heterozygous de novo mu-tations have been identified in the Munc18-1 gene that cause the infantile epileptic encephalopathies Ohtahara West and Dravet syndrome but it is unknown how these mutations affect neurons and trigger three different diseases. The central hypothesis based on strong preliminary data is that mutations in Munc18-1 result indefects in its folding stability and localization and elicit same defects in wild-type Munc18-1. This loss of functional Munc18-1 subsequently impairs the function of its effectors and triggers synaptic dysfunction which canbe restored by stabilizing Munc18-1. The rationale for these studies is that understanding of how mutations inMunc18-1 trigger synaptic dysfunction in infantile epileptic encephalopathies will create opportunities for thedevelopment of novel therapies beyond the current limited symptom-based therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data this hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of disease-relevantmutations in Munc18-1 on protein stability; 2) Determine how Munc18-1 mutants affect the stability of its effectors and synapse function; and 3) Identify rescue strategies to stabilize Munc18-1 and restore its function. Under the first aim stability folding aggregation and intracellular targeting will be quantified for Munc18-1 wild-type and mutants combining purified recombinant proteins and primary neurons with biochemical and cell biological techniques. Under the second aim stability interaction and targeting of Munc18-1's effectors syntaxin-1 Doc2 Mint1 Mint2 and rab3 as well as synapse integrity and function will be analyzed using purified proteins primary neurons and in vivo mouse and worm models. Under the third aim chemical and molecularchaperones will be employed to restore deficits in Munc18-1 and in synapse structure and function usingsame paradigms as for aims 1 and 2. This research is significant because it will clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying Munc18-1-linked epilepsies and will have translational importance in the development of newrational treatments. This research is innovative because it 1) tests the novel hypothesis that Munc18-1 mutations cause synaptic dysfunction via a dominant-negative mechanism 2) uses a multidisciplinary and systematic approach that has not previously been used in this research area 3) is technically innovative because ofnewly generated C. elegans strains and 4) shifts focus from a symptom-centered perspective to an approachthat focusses on understanding convergent underlying disease mechanisms that pivot on Munc18-1.,362381

About 30% of patients donot respond to current therapies. Thus a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive the disease arerequired. By analyzing the expression level of every gene in the rat hippocampus in 3 different epilepsymodels in 11 institutions and 3 time points after seizure induction we have found a core driver of long termgene changes in the epileptic brain. This complex is called Polycomb. This project will study the role ofPolycomb in the progression of epilepsy.,NINDS,9839728,7/30/2019 0:00,PA-18-484,1R01NS108756-01A1,1,R01,NS,108756,1,A1,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",8/1/2019 0:00,5/31/2024 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BDCN-E(02)M], ,7052279,"ROOPRA, AVTAR S","DINGLEDINE, RAYMOND J",2,NEUROSCIENCES,161202122,LCLSJAGTNZQ7,161202122,LCLSJAGTNZQ7,US,43.068519,-89.400858,578503,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,MADISON,WI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,537151218,UNITED STATES,N,8/1/2019 0:00,5/31/2020 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2019,511803, ,NINDS,398477,113326, ,Project Summary/Abstract Epilepsy is the 4th most prevalent neurological disorder after stroke Alzheimers and migraine with anincidence of 1 in 26 individuals. Though there are a number of anti-convulsant drugs available there are noanti-epileptogenic drugs that mitigate the progression of the disease. Using novel bioinformatic approacheswe have identified an endogenous protective program launched by the brain after a prolonged seizure thatfunctions to mitigate pathological changes. Epileptogenesis is associated with a plethora of changes in the brain including alterations in plasticitycell death neurogenesis inflammation and axonal sprouting. These changes occur over timescales rangingfrom many minutes to years but the orchestrating mechanisms are virtually unknown. Long-term changes ingene expression that are associated with epileptogenesis imply that one or more master regulators oftranscription may be coordinating the brain alterations. In order to uncover these transcriptional mechanismswe turned to our recently published genome-wide expression datasets generated by the Epilepsy MicroarrayConsortium (EMC). The datasets consist of mRNA expression profiles of rat dentate granule cells assayed atvarious time points after Status Epilepticus (SE). Using a novel bioinformatic tool that integrates wholegenome transcription factor binding data with gene expression profiles we analyzed datasets derived frombrains induced by 3 different convulsant stimuli each in 2 independent labs and at various time-points. Thisanalysis projected that Polycomb target genes represent the majority of chronically altered genes duringepileptogenesis. REST targets represent a second overlapping group of repressed genes. Polycomb is awell-known driver of life-long changes in gene expression that works by epigenetically silencing genes acrossthe phyla. Our data shows an extremely robust induction of EZH2 protein (the catalytic methylase subunit ofPolycomb) over a 20 day window post SE in neurons. Further we find that antagonizing EZH2 shortly afterSE robustly accelerates the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice suggesting a protective ratherthan pathological role for EZH2. How antagonism of EZH2 later after SE remains to be determined. In this project we will test the hypothesis that an alteration in Polycomb output is a principal modifier ofepileptogenesis. We will ascertain whether EZH2 upregulation is always protective or whether its role evolvesduring the latent period. We will test the effect of an order-of-magnitude change in EZH2 levels on corepressorfunction to see whether such upregulation augments or hampers the repressive abilities of two major EZH2containing complexes: Polycomb and REST. We anticipate that these studies will establish Polycomb asa major orchestrator of the long-term changes associated with epileptogenesis. If so approaches thatmodulate Polycomb function may be of benefit to the 65 million people world-wide that live withepilepsy.,511803

Recent pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggests that cannabidiol (CBD) may provide an effective tolerable alternative to current therapeutics however its mechanism of action is unclear. In this study I will examine a newly described proposed target for cannabidiol and examine potential pathways by which CBD controls seizure activity at the synaptic systems and in vivo level.,NINDS,9831170,11/21/2019 0:00,PA-14-150,5F30NS100293-04,5,F30,NS,100293,4, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",12/12/2016 0:00,5/29/2020 0:00,NST-2 Study Section [NST-2], ,11443627,"ROSENBERG, EVAN CORY",Not Applicable,12,NEUROLOGY,121911077,M5SZJ6VHUHN8,121911077,M5SZJ6VHUHN8,US,40.669895,-73.974354,5998304,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10016,UNITED STATES,N,12/12/2019 0:00,5/29/2020 0:00,853,"Training, Individual",2020,31975, ,NINDS,31975, , ,This proposal focuses on examining the mechanism of cannabidiol (CBD) a non-psychoactive component of cannabis with documented anti-seizure effects in several pre-clinical studies(1 2) and a recent double-blinded multicenter phase III clinical trial in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy(3 4). Despite centuries of clinical usage the mechanism of action of CBD remains ambiguous. Further exploring the pharmacology of CBD may provide benefit to the 1/3 of epilepsy patients with seizures resistant to current treatments (10).  In one leading hypothesis CBD acts as a competitive antagonist at the G-protein coupled receptor GPR55 inhibiting binding of a membrane phospholipid lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). CBD blocks LPI- mediated increases in presynaptic Ca2+ and vesicular release thus reducing excitability at axon terminals (12). However the function of LPI-GPR55 signaling at inhibitory synapses as well as potential postsynaptic effects remains to be explored.  Using a multidisciplinary approach with ex vivo whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and in vitro immunocytochemistry and molecular biology I discovered that LPI had unique effects at excitatory and inhibitory synapses both at the pre- and postsynapse. At 5-10 minutes post application LPI increased the frequency of vesicular release in CA1 hippocampus consistent with previous reports of presynaptic locus of GPR55 action(12). However contrary to prior studies I identified prominent GPR55 staining in the cell bodies of CA1 pyramidal neurons and a postsynaptic LPI effect of increased GluA1 AMPAR expression at 50-60 minutes post application. I also determined that LPI reduced inhibitory postsynaptic strength in part by reducing GABAAR 2 subunit expression. Taken together these results suggest that LPI increases the excitatory / inhibitory ratio in hippocampal neuronal networks by a dual mechanism: enhancing excitatory transmission and attenuating inhibition. This predicts that CBD by opposing LPI action may exert its beneficial anti-seizure effects on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses through actions at GPR55. I plan to explore these possibilities by repeating these experiments with CBD pre-treatment and GPR55-/- mice as controls.  To supplement these experiments at the circuit level I plan to investigate how LPI and CBD regulate evoked transmission and short-term plasticity in CA3-CA1 hippocampal circuits. At the in vivo level I will use both acute and chronic seizure models to determine seizure susceptibility in GPR55-/- mice. Based on surprising preliminary results I discovered that seizure activity upregulates GPR55 membrane expression producing a biomarker for prolonged seizures and potentiating the effects of LPI. In all as part of this fellowship I propose to combine my clinical training and scientific experience to elucidate the mechanisms of this intriguing therapeutic target for epilepsy and help stratify subpopulations for targeted treatment.,31975

Characterized as an infantile-onset epilepsy that leads to severe autistic-like cognitiveimpairment with high rates of sudden unexplained death (SUDEP) DS is caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in SCN1A encoding the type 1 voltage-gated sodium channel. Although a mechanistic basisof the syndrome remains poorly understood studies using animal models strongly suggest that Scn1a mutationsselectively impair PV and SST inhibitory interneurons and conditional deletion of Scn1a in forebrain interneuronswas previously shown to fully recapitulate the epileptic phenotype. This selective impairment of interneuronsmakes DS a promising target for the development of therapy based on transplantation of exogenousinterneurons which can migrate long distances from the injection site and integrate synaptically with surroundingcortical interneurons (INs) within host brain. This unique ability has driven the successful use of interneuronsderived from fetal tissue to treat acquired epilepsy in rodent models. However it remains unclear whether arodent model of a genetic epilepsy can be treated effectively with interneurons that are derived from stem cellsa more clinically applicable viable alternative to fetal cells. Additionally while the physiological roles ofendogenous PV and SST cells are relatively well established it remains unknown how engrafted PV- and SST-fated precursors mature and influence host activity. To address these important questions we will study theeffect of transplants at the level of single cells circuits and whole animals. We hypothesize that mouseembryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived interneuron transplants will synaptically integrate into the epilepticbrain of DS mice improve circuit-level disinhibition in vitro and suppress seizures in vivo. In aim 1 I willuse whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute brain slices to determine whether transplanted PV andSST interneuron transplants demonstrate intrinsic maturity and influence host activity at the level of interneuronsubtype-specific microcircuits. In aim 2 I will assess the inhibitory influence of transplants in vivo by first usingoptogenetics and calcium imaging to assess inhibition of endogenous excitatory neurons and then assessingthe transplants effect on seizures in DS mice.,32585

Uncontrolled tonic-clonic seizures place patients at high riskof sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) a major cause of mortality in patients withdrug-resistant epilepsy. The high-fat very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (KDs) help somepatients with uncontrolled epilepsy especially children but have been described as unpalatableand are often not tolerated by patients leading to high rates of non-compliance.We have obtained preliminary data from a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome (DS) a devastatingchildhood-onset epilepsy with refractory seizures and a high incidence of SUDEP and foundseizure-induced death is greatly reduced by supplementing their diet with milk whey (WD). ThisWD was just as protective as two different KDs but did not require an increase in ketone bodies.Moreover our preliminary studies suggest that a WD and KDs increase 5-HT levels and 5-HTrelease in the brain of mice. This is important as 5-HT is known to inhibit seizures and also playsa critical role in control of breathing. Defects in the 5-HT system have been linked to bothrespiratory dysfunction and SUDEP. In this proposed project we will test the hypotheses that 1)whey prevents seizure-induced death by reducing seizure frequency and/or stimulating postictalbreathing via increased brain 5-HT and 2) whey prevents postictal death by reversing the basicunderlying defect in DS mice which is thought to be a decrease in excitability of GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. To determine how a WD affects seizures breathing and neurochemistrywe will use video-EEG/EKG to evaluate the anticonvulsant effects of a WD on spontaneous andhyperthermia-induced seizures and in vivo microdialysis with high performance liquidchromatography to measure extracellular 5-HT in the amygdala a region implicated in seizurepropagation and postictal apnea. We will perform patch clamp recordings on hippocampal brainslices from WD-fed DS mice to evaluate intrinsic electrophysiological properties of interneuronsand pyramidal neurons and will determine if changes in excitability due to the WD are mediatedby increased 5-HT signaling. These studies will provide preclinical data that may guide futureclinical trials to evaluate milk whey supplementation as a safe and healthy dietary therapy fordrug-resistant epilepsy that is more palatable and effective than the KD. These experiments mayalso lead to new avenues of treatment targeted at the serotonergic mechanisms engaged by milkwhey.,32358

Human and experimental research show that pathogenic variation in SCN1A is a risk factor forsudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in about 4% of individuals affected by DS and in unknown fractionof individuals affected by the milder GEFS+ phenotype. While the majority of SCN1A carriers escape SUDEP itremains unclear when the SCN1A gene based variation becomes a liability for premature mortality and acorrelation among SCN1A properties and SUDEP risk has never been evaluated. Experimental and humanresearch in epilepsy and SUDEP suggests that modifier alleles may exert their effects through intragenic oroligogenic mechanism or through gene interaction networks. It is our central hypothesis that SCN1A gene basedliability to SUDEP rests either in (a) an intragenic SCN1A gene based patterns of common variants withsubthreshold effect co-segregating with de novo and inherited rare pathogenic variants functionallymanifest in the epileptic phenotype and/or in (b) co-occurrence of de novo and inherited rare pathogenicvariants in other known SUDEP genes. In this pilot study we plan to apply novel computational methods toprobe three questions (i) is the combined effects of common and rare SCN1A gene variants sufficient andnecessary to result in SUDEP in carriers of pathogenic SCN1A variants (aim 1)? (ii) is SUDEP risk modulatedby co-variation in known sudden death genes (SUDEP genes) (aim2)? (iii) does co-variation in SUDEP genesaffect mortality risk in patients with febrile seizure phenotype independent of SCN1A gene (aim 3)? We plan toaddress questions by evaluating clinical profiles and outcome data as well as exome based and copy numbervariants in 62 known SUDEP genes in two patient cohorts (a) in over 300 carriers of pathogenic variants in theSCN1A gene referred for whole exome clinical sequencing to the Baylor Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory (BG)(aims 1 and 2) and b) in 172 probands and 68 familial controls of the FEBrile STATus epilepticus study(FEBSTAT) cohort.

In addition to seizures patients suffer from behavioral and developmentaldelay ataxia intellectual disability and an increased risk (~18%) of Sudden Unexpected Deathin EPilepsy (SUDEP). The mechanism of SUDEP is not clear and there are no biomarkerscurrently known to identify at risk patients. We study DS because of its high incidence of SUDEPto better understand SUDEP mechanisms. In most cases (>80%) DS is linked to mutations ingenes which encode voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) subunits SCN1A and SCN1B whichencode the Nav1.1  subunit and the VGSC 1 subunit respectively. SCN1A and SCN1B areexpressed in both brain and heart. 1 regulates gating and kinetics of the ion channel porefunctions as a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) and initiates cell signaling. In ventricular myocytesphosphorylated 1 localizes to intercalated disks and associates with the tetrodotoxin (TTX)-insensitive VGSC  subunit Nav1.5 while non-phosphorylated 1 localizes to t-tubules where itassociates with the TTX-sensitive VGSC  subunits Nav1.1 Nav1.3 and Nav1.6. We proposethe high incidence of SUDEP in DS patients results from neuronal hyperexcitability and cardiacarrhythmia due to expression of mutant VGSC subunits in brain and heart. Scn1b null mice modelDS. Scn1b null mice display prolonged QT intervals by electrocardiogram abnormal calciumhandling that is sensitive to TTX and increased transient and persistent sodium currents inacutely isolated ventricular myocytes. Scn1b null mice show increased expression of Scn3a andScn5a encoding Nav1.3 and Nav1.5 respectively.  subunits are substrates for sequentialcleavage by -site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and -secretase. Sequential cleavagegenerates a soluble intracellular domain (ICD). We hypothesize that 1 cleavage in heartfollowed by 1-ICD translocation to the nucleus is critical for the transcriptional regulation ofVGSC  subunits and potentially other genes important in regulating cardiac excitability.

The assay designs are considered in the context of analysis and progression strategies for evaluation of approved drugs and investigational agents using high throughput screening technologies. The lab has a strong emphasis on methods development research to advance assay and screening efficiency in drug discovery and chemical genomics. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs):   AMP deaminase (AMPD) deficiency: In collaboration with K. Nagaraju (Children's National Medical Center) the ADST laboratory is developing a coincidence reporter assay to aid in the discovery of compounds that increase expression of the enzyme AMP deaminase implicated in the disease idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM).  IIM is a rare autoimmune progressive disease that afflicts the skeletal muscle of patients.  IIM is comprised of errors in both immune regulation and intrinsic muscle metabolism.  AMP deaminase (AMPD) catalyzes the deamination of AMP to IMP.  In humans AMPD activity is encoded by at least three genes. AMPD isoforms have tissue specific expression patterns in adults and stage specific expression patterns during the muscle development.  Drugs which stimulate the expression of AMPD1 are hypothesized to reverse muscle weakness. Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA):  In collaboration with D. Bodine (NHGRI NIH) and G. Thomas (U. Cincinnati) the ADST laboratory is developing assay strategies as part of a translational research project for DBA a rare congenital disease seen in all ethnic groups with a frequency of  7 cases per million live births. The diagnosis is usually made in the 1st yr of life as a severe anemia that requires transfusion. Unlike other anemias DBA patients have no reticulocytes in peripheral blood indicating a failure of erythropoiesis whereas production of the white cells and platelets are unaffected.  For a small minority of patients bone marrow transplantation from a healthy sibling is a curative therapy.  For patients without a suitable donor a variety of palliative therapies that can prolong life into the third decade.  Current treatments include corticosteroid therapy which results in reduced growth and other complications or lifelong transfusion and iron chelation.Discovery of Drugs for inherited rare blinding retinal degenerations:  Donald J. Zack M.D. Ph.D. a Johns Hopkins researcher funded by the Foundation Fighting Blindness is collaborating with Dr. Ingleses ADST laboratory in a public-private partnership aimed at alleviating and curing blinding retinal degenerative diseases. Together they are utilizing ADSTs expertise in assay development chemical biology and quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) to develop assays and chemical library testing paradigms to identify drugs and compounds that have the potential to save and restore vision for people affected by devastating retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration the leading cause of blindness in Americans over 50 years of age. The use of primary rodent retinal cells a limiting cell type typical for typical HTS experiments benefits from the low-volume assay technology employed in the Inglese laboratory at NCATS. Development of a cell-based high throughput quantitative microscopy-based assay for glucose-regulating multienzyme compartment:   In collaboration with S. An (UMBC) the ADST laboratory of NCATS is developing a 1536-well plate format high throughput quantitative microscopy-based assay for discovery of compounds that modulate the formation of a dynamically assembled multienzyme complex regulating glucose-derived carbon flux in cells.  Given that glucose metabolism is the central metabolic pathway that balances the cellular needs for both energy and building blocks the pilot screening of pharmacologically active small molecules for or against the assembly will assist to understand the biological significance of the assembly in the cell. In turn extensive high throughput screening is anticipated to discover novel pharmacophores which promote or disrupt the assembly in human disease models for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of glucose metabolism-associated human diseases. Exploration of novel sources of chemical libraries for antimalarial activity:  To probe the biological activity of the stereochemical and structural complexity of novel academic chemical libraries and the chemical diversity of natural products extracts (NPEs) the ADST laboratory is testing the antimalarial potential of these chemical repositories.  In a multi-investigator collaboration effort with D. Sherman (U. Michigan) J. Clardy (HMS) J. Porco (BU) S. Schaus (BU) A. Beeler (BU) J.K. Snyder (BU) X.-z. Su (NIAID NIH) the ADST laboratory has determined EC50s for Plasmodium falciparum viability for each of 2070 members of the Boston University CMLD compound collection and >1600 NPEs assembled at the University of Michigan using quantitative high-throughput screening across five parasite lines of distinct geographic origin. From the BU library three compound classes displaying either differential or comprehensive antimalarial activity across the lines were identified. From the NPE library a novel recently discovered compound called Actinoramide A was found to display potent antimalarial activity. The molecular basis for the activity of these compounds is being investigated.  Assays for the identification of small molecules up-regulating Scn1a gene expression.  Dravet syndrome a severe epileptic disorder is caused by nonsense mutations in the SCN1A gene resulting in a non-functional protein. In collaboration with V. Broccoli (Institute of Neuroscience Milan) we are developing mouse ES cells capable of differentiation to neurons containing a coincidence reporter biocircuit edited into the genetic locus encoding the alpha subunit of the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel.  Small molecules that up-regulate the unaffected allele of SCN1A may provide a compensatory mechanism for disease treatment.    Controlling cellular senescence with small molecule compounds modulating the 133p53 isoform:  In collaboration with C. Harris (NCI) the ADST laboratory of NCATS is developing a 1536-well plate format high throughput laser-cytometry based assay for discovery of compounds that modulate the cellular distribution and half-life of specific p53 isoform in cells.  The demonstrated functional and regulatory role served by 133p53 between cellular senescence and autophagy is relevant to both aging and cancer.  Compounds effective in modulating cellular phenotypes based on expression of a GFP- 133p53 sensor will be explored for their pharmacological effect in relevant aging and cancer model systems.,401338

Approximately 30% ofepileptic patients have treatment resistant (refractory) seizures thereby presenting a major clinical challengeand burden. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of refractory human epilepsy and mesialtemporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common form of TLE. Approximately 20% of patients with MTLE failto achieve adequate seizure control. MTLE is characterized by spontaneous seizures hippocampal sclerosisand neuropsychological deficits. At present surgical resection of the epilepsy focus is the best treatmentstrategy for this disorder; however this procedure is only used in a subset of cases. Consequently there is aneed to develop alternative treatments that can effectively mitigate the broad spectrum of clinical featuresassociated with MTLE while minimizing unwanted side effects. Reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (rAChEIs) (e.g. Huperzine A and donepezil) are most widelyused in the treatment of dementia and Alzheimer's disease; however there is increasing evidence that thisclass of compounds might be therapeutic in the treatment of epilepsy. Recently published data from our groupdemonstrated that the Huperzine A provides robust and sustained protection against induced seizures in amouse model of the catastrophic treatment-resistant encephalopathy Dravet syndrome (DS). In addition wenow provide preliminary data demonstrating 1) that donepezil can also increase resistance to induced seizuresin the DS model and 2) that Hup A dramatically reduces spontaneous seizure development in the intra-hippocampal kainic acid (IH-KA) mouse model of MTLE. Based on these observations and the ability ofrAChEIs to also protect against inflammation and cell death and promote neurogenesis we hypothesize thatthis class of compounds will be particularly efficacious in the treatment of MTLE. We will test this hypothesis byevaluating and comparing the ability of Hup A and donepezil to reduce spontaneous seizure frequency andseverity (Aim 1) and ameliorate behavioral abnormalities and neuron loss (Aim 2) in the IH-KA mouse model ofMTLE. This study will also have broader implications for the treatment of other forms of refractory epilepsy.,425449

Common synthetic strategies require prefunctionalization to introduceheteroatoms and larger functional groups rendering the molecules difficult to handle purify and subject tofurther diversification. Nature approaches such synthetic bottlenecks by constructing simple cores anddecorating scaffolds later on in biosynthesis. Chemists take inspiration from Natures techniques in designinglate-stage CH functionalization routes but the ability of enzymes to generate molecular complexity isunmatched by state-of-the-art synthetic methods. Thus biocatalysis represents a unique approach to tacklingthe synthetic challenges associated with drug design.Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are an untapped source of antiepileptic drug targets. Over 50 naturally derivedPSTs have been identified and the select few that have been assessed for binding to voltage-gated sodiumchannels (VGSCs) have demonstrated the ability to block VGSCs. This molecular response corresponds tophysical responses desired in antiepileptic drug targets. The study of PSTs as antiepileptic drug targets hasbeen hindered by challenging synthetic routes and the inability to isolate sufficient quantities of most of the >50analogs. Gene clusters associated with paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthesis have been identified enablingopportunities to leverage enzymes capable of chemistry inaccessible to even the most skilled chemist. Thisproposal describes strategies to elucidate the paralytic shellfish toxin biosynthetic pathway evaluate enzymesubstrate scopes and isolate novel compounds from biocatalytic reactions for analysis with VGSCs usingelectrophysiological techniques.In summary this work aims to diversify the PST scaffold using PST biosynthetic enzymes from cyanobacteriaenabling chemical transformations on complex heteroatom-rich molecules that are otherwise intractable. Themethods established in this proposal will accelerate the discovery of new antiepileptic drugs by developing newchemical reactions using biocatalysts from the biosynthetic pathway of known VGSC blocking compounds.,36604

Symptoms in severe childhoodepilepsies such as Dravet syndrome (DS) are not limited to seizures but typically involve increased anxietyautism spectrum disorder intellectual disability and circadian and sleep disorders. Most treatments forepilepsies target seizure severity and frequency but do not necessarily focus on remaining symptomswhich greatly diminish the quality of life of patients and caregivers. In this proposal we test the hypothesisthat improving circadian and sleep regulation in DS will not only result in decreased seizure frequency andseverity but also in an improvement of other symptoms of the disease. To test predictions of this hypothesiswe capitalize on a mouse model of DS. As DS patients DS mice have a heterozygous loss-of-functionmutation in the SCN1A gene which codes for the primary voltage-gated Na+ channel in adult GABAergicneurons. DS mice show most symptoms of the disease including febrile and spontaneous seizuresincreased anxiety autistic behavior cognitive deficits and dysregulation of circadian rhythms and sleep.Thus DS mice represent a reliable genotypic and phenotypic model of the disease. Here we propose toincrease the 24-h temporal structure of the environment to improve both circadian and homeostaticregulation of sleep and in turn to determine whether these improvements result in reduced seizure severityand frequency reduced anxiety improved social behavior and cognitive performance.Aim 1 will assess the ability of wheel-running restriction to the dark phase food restriction to the dark phaseor a combination of both routines to improve behavioral physiological and molecular circadian rhythms toincrease sleep hygiene and to reduce seizure frequency in both male and female DS mice. Aim 2 willdetermine whether the best routine in improving these outcomes will be also effective in reducing anxietyincreasing social behavior and improving memory consolidation.Until now most treatments of childhood epilepsies including DS involve pharmacological treatments thatseek to reduce seizure severity and frequency. Many of these treatments are ineffective in treating DS andthe development of non-pharmacological non-invasive treatments that improve symptoms holistically offersgreat promise to improve the quality of life of DS patients as well as patients with other forms of severeepilepsy. Our proposal exploits a reliable animal model of DS to test potential treatments that because oftheir minimal invasiveness could be implemented in DS patients.,77750

Therapy that improves function of defective interneurons is notavailable. Structural development and maintenance of interneurons is dependent on trophic support providedby brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation of TrkB receptors. In the undercut (UC) model ofepileptogenic neocortical injury chronic activation of TrkB-Rs with a selective small molecule partial agonist(LM22A-4 LM below) has long-term effects to reverse structural and functional abnormalities in inhibitoryterminals of PV interneurons enhance GABA release and increase the threshold for evoking epileptiformactivity and seizures. In order to determine whether these effects will be applicable to treatment or preventionof epilepsy in other models with different causes for seizures such as genetic epilepsies the Dravet syndrome(DS) mouse will be used in some experiments. Decreases in a membrane sodium channel in PV interneuronsin DS mice causes decreased release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA and development of spontaneousand high temperature-induced seizures. A variety of experimental approaches in DS and UC mice will be usedto determine whether chronic treatment with LM by increasing GABA release from nerve terminals of SOMand PV interneurons or inducing new inhibitory synapse formation will enhance inhibition in cortical networksand suppress epileptiform discharges: 1) immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging will be used to assessalterations in PV and SOM presynaptic terminals including changes in expression of VGAT- and GAD65/67-IR and the calcium sensor protein synaptotagmin 2; 2) analysis of density of SOM/- and PV/gephyrin closeappositions to test for new inhibitory synapse formation induced by TrkB activation; 3) electrophysiologicalanalysis of basic properties of inhibitory synaptic transmission from PV interneurons to pyramidal neurons of invitro slices to detect effects of TrkB activation on unitary IPSCs release probability and transmission failures;3) laser scanning photostimulation of cortical slices from PV/CHR2 and SOM/CHR2 mice to map thedistribution and strength of inhibitory connectivity in neocortical inhibitory circuits; and 4) video/EEG monitoringof implanted mice to assess effects of treatment with LM on spontaneous seizures and hyperthermia-inducedseizures. Results of these experiments will provide information about mechanisms leading from interneuronalabnormalities to development of epilepsy and a potential approach to prophylaxis of epileptogenesis byenhancing trophic support of interneurons.,344405

Mutations in them cause inherited epilepsy migraine chronic pain and periodicparalysis and they are important molecular targets for drugs. A. New insights into structure and function of Navchannels have come from our high-resolution x-ray crystallography of their bacterial ancestor NavAb. We willfurther define the structural basis for key functional properties of mammalian Nav channels by building theircharacteristic structural features into NavAb including the structural basis for voltage-dependent activation ionselectivity and fast inactivation. Based on these results we will determine the structural basis for impaired Navchannel function by mutations that cause periodic paralysis and the chronic pain syndromes erythromelalgiaand paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. B. Failure of learning and memory is a debilitating aspect of aging andneurodegenerative disease yet we do not understand the basic mechanisms of these crucial brain processesand we cannot intervene effectively in these deficits. Learning and memory takes place primarily at synapses.Presynaptic calcium (Cav2.1) channels initiate neurotransmitter release at most synapses in the brain. Theactivity of these channels is tightly regulated by a large complex of signaling proteins including calmodulin andrelated calcium-sensor proteins. Our work implicates Cav2.1 channel regulation in short-term synaptic plasticityin transfected synapses in cultured neurons and in a novel mouse model in which the IM-AA mutation isinserted into Cav2.1. We will further define the molecular and structural mechanism for Cav2.1 channelregulation determine the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels in short-term synaptic plasticity of neuralcircuits and explore the role of regulation of Cav2.1 channels and short-term synaptic plasticity in spatiallearning and memory. Our experiments with this unique mouse model will give unique insights into themechanism of short-term presynaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons and its role in integrative bbrainfunction. C. Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a devastating childhood neuropsychiatric disorder caused by de novoheterozygous loss-of-function mutations in Nav1.1. We developed a mouse genetic model with all the featuresof DS including thermally induced and spontaneous seizures ataxia circadian rhythm and sleep disorderscognitive deficit autistic-like features and premature death via SUDEP. Physiological and genetic studiesshow that all these effects are correlated with loss of Na currents and excitability of GABAergic interneuronswithout consistent effects on excitatory neurons which causes imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neuralcircuits. To further advance understanding of pathophysiology and treatment of DS we will determine theneural cells and circuits responsible for DS using specific deletion by the Cre-Lox method identify the sites ofhyperexcitability in neural cells and circuits that appear first in DS mice in vivo and optimize next-generationcombination therapy for seizures status epilepticus cognitive deficit and premature death in DS.,580499

The multiplicity of causes of thedisease poses an obvious challenge to the development of a general therapeutic approach. Evenwhen epilepsy is caused by a single gene alteration such as in Dravet syndrome in humans thechanges in the activity of the affected neurons can be too severe to be successfully targeted bythe existing drugs. Our findings revealed a novel signaling control mechanism that has a majorpotential for the treatment of epilepsy. The ability of the brain-enriched microRNA miR-128 tomodulate the activity of signaling networks that include many of the epilepsy-linked signalingproteins points to a potential use of a miR-128 based therapy for epilepsy treatment.,NINDS,9741889,9/7/2018 0:00,PA-18-591,3R01NS091574-04S1,3,R01,NS,91574,4,S1,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",9/1/2015 0:00,8/31/2020 0:00,"Neurotransporters, Receptors, and Calcium Signaling Study Section[NTRC]", ,9344236,"SCHAEFER, ANNE ",Not Applicable,13,NEUROSCIENCES,78861598,C8H9CNG1VBD9,78861598,C8H9CNG1VBD9,US,40.790284,-73.946781,3839801,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,100296574,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2018 0:00,8/31/2020 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2018,156451, ,NINDS,100000,56451, ,PROJECT SUMMARYThe current project addresses a novel regulatory mechanism of neuronal activity by microRNAs and its rolein controlling animal behavior and epilepsy. We found that a neuron-enriched microRNA miR-128 acts as anegative master modulator of neuronal signaling responses in mice. The importance of the miR-128 in brainfunction is underscored by the development of fatal epileptic seizures in mice that lack miR-128 in postnatalforebrain neurons. Accordingly overexpression of miR-128 in neurons attenuates chemically-inducedseizures and rescues survival in mice.These findings reveal miR-128 as a previously unknown key regulatorof neuronal activity with a potential for the development of novel anti-epileptic therapeutic approaches.The major regulatory function of miR-128 highlights the importance of the mechanisms that control miR-128expression levels as well as miR-128 access to its targets in neurons. We found that calcineurin/NFATactivity an important signaling pathway in neuronal development and function controls miR-128 expressionin neurons. Most importantly mice with neuronal calcineurin deficiency develop a fatal seizure syndromesimilar to the one observed in mice with miR-128 deficiency. These findings provided a strong indication forthe role of calcineurin/NFAT signaling in control of miR-128 expression. The mechanism ofcalcineurin/NFAT-mediated regulation of miR-128 expression will be addressed in this proposal. Theproposal also addresses a novel mechanism of regulation of miR-128 effector function. Preliminary datasuggest that access of miR-128 to its mRNA targets is regulated by miR-128-sequestring non-coding decoyRNAs. This novel mechanism of regulation of miR-128 effector function will be explored in experimentsusing unique mouse models with inactivation or overexpression of the neuron-specific miR-128 decoy RNAsin combination with the molecular electrophysiological and behavioral approaches that have beenestablished in our laboratory. The central role of miR-128 in neuronal signaling makes this miRNA anattractive target for potential therapeutic intervention of epilepsy. Using a mouse model of the human Dravetsyndrome one the most severe and often treatment resistant forms of epilepsy the proposal will explore thetherapeutic potential of neuronal miR-128 modulation for the treatment of the disease. To bring the researchcloser to the development of actual antiepileptic therapy we will explore the antiepileptic potential ofexogenously expressed miR-128. MiR-128 will be delivered to defined neurons using neurotrophic adeno-associated viruses (AAV) that are currently considered as the most reliable vehicle for in vivo gene deliveryin mice and human. In summary our proposal describes highly innovative and hypothesis driven studies ofa novel non-coding RNA mechanism for controlling neuronal signaling and activity that has a strongpotential to be applied for the treatment of human epilepsy.,156451

Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the voltage-gatedsodium channel  subunit gene SCN1A (encoding the protein Nav1.1) are associated with multiple forms oftreatment-resistant epilepsy including Dravet syndrome (DS) a catastrophic early-life encephalopathy. As 70-80% of cases of DS can be attributed to a reduction in functional Nav1.1 strategies that can increase SCN1Atranscription from the wild-type allele are predicted to improve patient outcomes. Despite the important role ofSCN1A in epilepsy and more broadly in the normal regulation of neuronal excitability little is currently knownabout the machinery underlying the regulation of SCN1A transcription. Therefore we are limited in our ability todevelop strategies to increase SCN1A transcription. We identified three predicted Functional GenomicElements (FGEs) within the SCN1A locus that significantly increased reporter activity in a dual luciferaseassay: FGE2 FGE17 and FGE23. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that FGE2 FGE17 and FGE23endogenously act as transcriptional enhancer elements for SCN1A. We will use the Synergistic ActivationMediator (dCas9SAM) system to localize transcriptional activators to these FGEs in neuronal cell culture.Previous studies have shown that localizing transcriptional activators to gene promoters or enhancers can elicitan increase in gene expression making dCas9SAM a powerful tool for evaluating putative regulatory elements.Additionally we will perform ATAC-seq on GABAergic interneurons which preferentially express SCN1A in aneffort to identify additional FGEs that contribute to SCN1A transcriptional regulation. Our preliminary data alsoshow that the minor allele of the epilepsy-associated SNP rs6732655 located in SCN1A intron 16significantly decreases reporter activity in a dual luciferase assay compared to the major allele. In Aim 2 wewill test the hypothesis that the rs6732655 minor allele introduces a silencer element thereby reducing SCN1Aexpression. We will examine SNP allele-dependent protein-binding in order to identify candidate factors thatbind to the minor allele. We will also knock-in the minor allele of this SNP to SH-SY5Y human neuroblastomacells to evaluate the endogenous impact on SCN1A expression. Our long-term goal is to translate thesefindings into clinically-relevant strategies for increasing Nav1.1 levels thereby providing new therapeuticoptions.,189927

Dravet syndrome is caused by mutation in the gene SCN1A which encodes the sodium(Na+) channel Nav1.1 How SCN1A mutation leads to the clinical entity known as Dravet syndromeremains unclear; this gap in knowledge has profoundly limited the practical impact that such a diagnosis hason treatment quality of life and long-term outcome for patients with this disorder.Prior work in experimental animal models of Dravet syndrome including Scn1a+/- mice suggests that loss ofNav1.1 leads to epilepsy via dysfunction of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex with themost prominent identified abnormalities being impaired action potential generation in a critical subtype ofinterneuron known as the parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneuron (PV-IN). However data presented hereindicates that surprisingly PV-IN dysfunction is transient being restricted to a brief time window in earlydevelopment with subsequent recovery of high frequency firing. Preliminary data suggests that the specificlocus of pathology in Dravet syndrome is actually PV-IN axons with abnormal action potential propagationleading to conduction delay and synaptic failure even though PV-INs have recovered the ability to generateaction potentials at high frequency. This finding has important implications for the development of noveltreatment approaches for Dravet syndrome such as cell transplantation gene therapy or precision medicine.This new 5-year application from the lab of an early stage investigator uses innovative neuroscienceapproaches to test this new hypothesis as to the mechanism of pathology in Dravet syndrome. Proposedexperiments will establish the molecular identity and physiological properties of Na+ channels in PV-IN axonsin Scn1a+/- mice as compared to wild-type controls using targeted recordings from interneuron axons anddetailed immunohistochemistry of axonal Na+ channels (Aim 1); determine the impact of PV-IN axonaldysfunction on the timing of feedforward inhibition in cerebral cortical circuits (Aim 2); and assess the activityof defined subsets of neurons in awake behaving Scn1a+/- mice using in vivo imaging and electrophysiologyto corroborate in vitro findings (Aim 3).The overall outcome of the proposed experiments will set forth a unifying hypothesis as to the pathophysiologyof Dravet syndrome. Such knowledge is critical to the development of novel targeted therapies for thiscurrently incurable and untreatable disease. The long-term objective of this line of research is to applypreclinical data from experimental model systems to the development of new mechanistically orientedtherapies in human patients.,403814

Equally devastating intellectual and behavioraldisabilities severely disrupt quality of life for patients and caregivers and have no effective therapy. Classicallyintellectual impairments have been considered a direct effect of uncontrolled seizures and research has beentargeted at improving seizure control. Recent work in systems neurophysiology suggests that specific patternsof brain activity so-called brain rhythms underlie cognition and that disruption of these rhythms impairsintellectual ability. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether loss-of-function mutations inScn1a are sufficient to disrupt SWR and whether spatial memory is impaired in parallel. To determine whetherseizures contribute to spatial memory impairment to determine whether restoration of Scn1a expression withgene therapy recovers normal SWR features and improves spatial memory we will use existing DS mousemodels and generate a novel DS model in which Scn1a expression can be recovered in a previously affectedmouse a genetic `cure'.

Current drug therapies are ineffective at controlling seizures and no therapy exists forsevere cognitive deficits. While seizure frequency and severity often improves children with DS who surviveinto their teenage years have IQs in the severely impaired range 50 to 70 and typically require permanentinstitutional or family care. Therapy for cognitive impairment would dramatically improve the lives of thesepatients substantially reduce long-term care costs and reduce accidental deaths. Work in genetic mousemodels which are faithful genocopies and phenocopies shows that inhibitory interneuron but not excitatorycell activity is impaired resulting in an in-balance between excitation and inhibition the likely cause of seizuresand co-morbidities. An emerging principle from systems-level neuroscience is that cognition depends onprecisely timed electrophysiologic patterns brain rhythms. Whether disrupted brain rhythms contribute tocognitive impairment in human disease and whether interventions targeted at normalization of rhythmsthrough pharmaceuticals targeted stimulation or via correction of genetic defect are a reasonable therapeuticstrategy remains to be determined. Hippocampal sharp - wave / ripple (SWR) complexes contribute to spatiallearning and memory and require high frequency temporally precise action potential firing in inhibitoryinterneurons. We hypothesize that: Decreased SWR recurrence and slowed intra-ripple frequency arecaused by hippocampal interneuron hypoexcitability and contribute to spatial memory impairment inDS mice. The proposed experiments will: (1) extend the preliminary finding of decreased ripple recurrence andslowed intra-ripple frequency in DS mice comparing SWR features by sleep-wake state and during context-dependent spatial learning to determine if rate of SWR occurrence and intra-ripple frequency are correlatedwith Scn1a expression and memory performance (2) determine whether spatial memory impairment ismediated through effects of reduced Scn1a expression reduced Na current and hypoexcitability of forebrainGABAergic interneurons (3) determine whether seizures contribute to spatial memory impairment and alteredSWR features and (4) determine whether altered SWR features and impaired spatial memory can benormalized with restoration of Na channel expression. This work will be organized around the following specificaims: Aim 1: Dependence of SWR recurrence intra-ripple frequency and spatial memory impairmenton Scn1a expression Aim 2: Contribution of seizures to reduced SWR occurrence slowed intra-ripplefrequency and spatial memory impairment,337969

Childhood epileptic encephalopathies are the most severe form of epilepsy with onset in early childhood multiple seizure types that are difficult to treat and poor developmental outcomes. There is considerable evidence that genetic mutations cause childhood epileptic encephalopathies and our recent research has identified several new genetic causes. However most cases are still not explained. This research will identify new genes and genetic pathways in epilepsy. Furthermore we will study the specific genetic changes disrupt normal brain function. Our results and will directly benefit individuals with epilepsy and their families through improved diagnostic prognostic and recurrence risk information. Greater understanding of the genes involved in normal development and function of the brain will facilitate improved therapies for this common disorder and benefit society as a whole.,NINDS,9693332,3/20/2019 0:00,PA-11-260,5R01NS069605-09,5,R01,NS,69605,9, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",2/15/2010 0:00,3/31/2020 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-GGG-A(90)S], ,2048128,"MEFFORD, HEATHER C.",Not Applicable,7,PEDIATRICS,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,4/1/2019 0:00,3/31/2020 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2019,485828, ,NINDS,314452,171376, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting as many as 1 in 26 individuals. The childhood epileptic encephalopathies (CEE) are the most severe types of epilepsy characterized by refractory seizures cognitive arrest or regression associated with ongoing epileptic activity and a poor prognosis. Identifying the genetic causes of CEE is the initial step toward developing more effective diagnostic tests prognosis counseling and treatments. Despite significant advances in gene discovery in recent years the majority of patient with CEE remain undiagnosed. Our recent work (R01NS069605) to investigate the genetic basis of epilepsy helped establish the role of copy number variants (CNVs) in CEE. More recently we use a high-throughput targeted sequencing strategy to screen 73 known and candidate CEE genes for mutations in a cohort of >500 CEE probands identifying pathogenic mutations in >10% of patients. Our studies identified CHD2 and SYNGAP1 as novel and important causes of CEE GRIN2A as a cause of epilepsy-aphasia syndromes and GABRA1 and STXBP1 as causes of a subset of SCN1A- negative Dravet syndrome. In this proposal we build upon these successes and propose three lines of investigation. First we will use trio exome sequencing in 150 patients with CEE who have already been screened for mutations in a large number of CEE genes and are therefore enriched for gene discovery. Second we will use high-throughput targeted of a panel of CEE and ID genes to investigate the role of these genes in several related neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Finally we will investigate the role of the chromatin remodeling pathway in epileptogenesis highlighted by the discovery of CHD2 mutations in a subset of CEE patients. Successful completion of our aims will lead to improved genetic diagnosis of patients better prognosis and recurrence risk counseling for families and novel targets for development of therapeutics.,485828

Uncontrolled tonic-clonic seizures place patients at high riskof sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) a major cause of mortality in patients withdrug-resistant epilepsy. The high-fat very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (KDs) help somepatients with uncontrolled epilepsy especially children but have been described as unpalatableand are often not tolerated by patients leading to high rates of non-compliance.We have obtained preliminary data from a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome (DS) a devastatingchildhood-onset epilepsy with refractory seizures and a high incidence of SUDEP and foundseizure-induced death is greatly reduced by supplementing their diet with milk whey (WD). ThisWD was just as protective as two different KDs but did not require an increase in ketone bodies.Moreover our preliminary studies suggest that a WD and KDs increase 5-HT levels and 5-HTrelease in the brain of mice. This is important as 5-HT is known to inhibit seizures and also playsa critical role in control of breathing. Defects in the 5-HT system have been linked to bothrespiratory dysfunction and SUDEP. In this proposed project we will test the hypotheses that 1)whey prevents seizure-induced death by reducing seizure frequency and/or stimulating postictalbreathing via increased brain 5-HT and 2) whey prevents postictal death by reversing the basicunderlying defect in DS mice which is thought to be a decrease in excitability of GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. To determine how a WD affects seizures breathing and neurochemistrywe will use video-EEG/EKG to evaluate the anticonvulsant effects of a WD on spontaneous andhyperthermia-induced seizures and in vivo microdialysis with high performance liquidchromatography to measure extracellular 5-HT in the amygdala a region implicated in seizurepropagation and postictal apnea. We will perform patch clamp recordings on hippocampal brainslices from WD-fed DS mice to evaluate intrinsic electrophysiological properties of interneuronsand pyramidal neurons and will determine if changes in excitability due to the WD are mediatedby increased 5-HT signaling. These studies will provide preclinical data that may guide futureclinical trials to evaluate milk whey supplementation as a safe and healthy dietary therapy fordrug-resistant epilepsy that is more palatable and effective than the KD. These experiments mayalso lead to new avenues of treatment targeted at the serotonergic mechanisms engaged by milkwhey.,31866

In ~80% of patients DSresults from loss-of-function mutations in the Scn1a gene which encodes brain voltage-gated sodium channeltype-I NaV1.1. Effective therapy for DS is extremely limited. The current first-line therapy for DS is a combinationof Onfi (clobazam) and valproic acid. Stiripentol (STP) is often added for pharmacoresistant patients but is notan FDA approved treatment. Unfortunately this combination not only fails to provide complete seizure controlbut also causes serious adverse events in over 50% of patients. Better therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.Encouragingly recent discoveries have unearthed a promising new pathway for treating this terrible disease.Animal studies in Scn1a+/- heterozygous knockout mice (a well-established animal model of DS) haveestablished that spontaneous seizures hyperthermia-induced seizures and high rates of premature death areassociated with reduced Gabra2 expression in the forebrain. Gabra2 encodes the production of the 2 proteinsubunit of GABAAR. Intriguingly clobazam and its metabolite N-desmethyl clobazam (NDMC) have modestselectivity in potentiating 2-containing GABAARs. High doses of clobazam (10 mg/kg) eliminate hyperthermia-induced seizures in Scn1a+/- heterozygous knockout mice. This may partially explain why clobazam is effectivein DS patients while other antiepileptics are not. STP not only increases NDMC levels through metabolic effectsbut is also selective for 3-containing GABAARs. As a whole this indicates that potentiating GABAARs containing2 and to a lesser extent 3 may play a significant role in controlling seizures in DS patients. NeuroCycleTherapeutics Inc. (NCT) specializes in the development of 2/3 subtype-selective GABAAR positive allostericmodulators. These compounds selectively potentiate 2 and 3 subtypes but have minimal effect on 1 subtypeswhich are associated with side effects such as sedation dependency ataxia and tolerance development. Ifeffective in DS models these selective compounds could deliver next-generation treatment for DS that iseffective well-tolerated and useable long-term. In preliminary studies these compounds are equally or moreefficacious than diazepam in multiple in vivo anticonvulsant models. They also show efficacy in treatment-refractory epileptic human cortical tissue. They display a significant margin of efficacy to side-effects and do notlose efficacy upon chronic dosing. In this Phase I SBIR application we propose to test two compounds withdifferentiated receptor profiles in two animal models of DS. Furthermore we will perform a preliminary evaluationof these compounds' suitability as preclinical candidates. If Phase I objectives are met we will apply to progressthe best compound into a Phase II SBIR project where additional pharmacology toxicology and pre-clinicaldevelopment will occur.,494651

In most children febrile seizures occur as isolated events but in some children with a geneticpredisposition febrile seizures occur frequently and can rapidly progress to afebrile (spontaneous) seizures.The goal of my research is to show that fever depresses synaptic inhibition which drives the onset of febrileseizures and that additional alterations occur within select inhibitory circuits to then drive the onset of afebrileseizures.,NINDS,9679519,6/5/2019 0:00,PAR-16-220,5K22NS105922-02,5,K22,NS,105922,2, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",6/1/2018 0:00,5/31/2020 0:00,ZNS1-SRB-M(04), ,12145617,"ANTOINE, MICHELLE ",Not Applicable,12,MISCELLANEOUS,124726725,GS3YEVSS12N6,124726725,GS3YEVSS12N6,US,37.870017,-122.268624,577502,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,BERKELEY,CA,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,947101749,UNITED STATES,N,6/1/2019 0:00,5/31/2020 0:00,853,Other Research-Related,2019,78300, ,NINDS,72500,5800, ,The research proposal is focused on deciphering the mechanisms causing febrile and afebrile seizuresespecially in cases of genetically linked epileptic encephalopathies such as Dravet syndrome. A specific short-term goal is to understand how fever interacts with genetics to increase seizure susceptibility. In the long-termI aim to incorporate genetic circuit and systems approaches to identify the causal mechanisms underlyingautism and epilepsy. To achieve my goals I have developed a 2-year training plan for learning advancedphysiology techniques such as in vivo whole-cell recordings two-photon calcium imaging and electroenceph-alogram recordings. These new skills will help expand my expertise into epilepsy research and provide astrong platform to build my independent research program. This training plan is rich in career developmentactivities that will provide essential avenues for me to optimize my skills in mentoring students writing papersand presenting scientific talks. In research during Phase I I will build on my preliminary findings which showthat temperatures within the fever range can decrease parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneuron-mediatedfeedforward inhibition a process I refer to as fever-induced depression of inhibition (FIDI). My aims aretherefore focused on establishing whether there is a causal link between FIDI and seizures in multiple mousemodels of febrile seizures and during the early postnatal stages of interneuron development. To complete thework during the mentored phase I have assembled a panel of experts that includes my mentor Dr. DanielFeldman an expert in neurophysiology and my scientific advisors Dr. Yang Dan a leader in the field of corticalneurophysiology Dr. Daniela Kaufer an expert in epileptogenesis mechanisms and finally AristeaGalanopoulou a clinical board certified epileptologist and neurophysiologist. The combination of this excellentadvisory team as well as the outstanding facilities provided by UC Berkeley will ensure that I make significantprogress towards my research and career goals. This training plan lays the groundwork for research to bedone during Phase II. The first research goal of Phase II is to establish causal roles for PV-mediated inhibitionin promoting both febrile and afebrile seizures. Specifically in a first aim I will test whether febrile and afebrileseizures can be blocked or delayed by chemo-genetically up-modulating local PV interneuron firing rates. I willalso examine the cellular and synaptic mechanisms in PV interneurons that could underlie FIDI. In a secondaim I will use chronic two-photon calcium imaging to characterize the temporal dynamics of network activitychanges within the pyramidal neurons and multiple interneuron cell populations during the period betweenfebrile and spontaneous seizure onset. This aim will identify the vulnerable timeframe when intervention maybe successful in hindering the progression from febrile to afebrile seizures. As a whole the work of Phase Iand Phase II will delineate potential synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlying the onset of febrile andafebrile seizures and will prepare me for a successful transition to becoming an independent investigator.,78300

Ion channel dysfunction is widely believed to form the basis of both inherited and acquired forms of epilepsy. This study will examine possible mechanisms causing dysfunction of the HCN1 ion channel both after acquired insults to the brain and in a recently identified human genetic epilepsy syndrome.,NINDS,9662845,3/8/2019 0:00,PA-13-302,5R01NS050229-12,5,R01,NS,50229,12, ,"CHURN, SEVERN BORDEN",7/1/2005 0:00,3/31/2021 0:00,Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section[CNNT], ,1861785,"POOLOS, NICHOLAS P",Not Applicable,7,NEUROLOGY,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,4/1/2019 0:00,3/31/2020 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2019,337969, ,NINDS,218750,119219, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are voltage-gated ion channels that modulate excitability in several brain regions involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy including the hippocampus neocortex and thalamus. Accumulated evidence shows that downregulation of Ih the current generated by HCN channels causes neuronal hyperexcitability and that genetic deletion of HCN1 channels the main cortical and hippocampal subtype accelerates the rate of epileptogenesis in acquired epilepsy models. More recent evidence shows that mutations in HCN1 underlie early life epileptic encephalopathy in some children with severe epilepsy and developmental delay. Thus HCN1 channelopathy occurs in both human genetic epilepsy and animal models of acquired epilepsy.  In recent work from our laboratory epilepsy induced by chemoconvulsant-induced status epilepticus (SE) was associated with loss of HCN1 channel expression that began within 1 hour post-SE and persisted into chronic epilepsy. HCN1 channels were acutely internalized from the surface membrane of hippocampal pyramidal dendrites within the first hour following SE well before the onset several days later of transcriptional downregulation of HCN1 mRNA expression. We now show for the first time that HCN1 channel surface expression is governed in a bidirectional fashion by protein kinase C (PKC) activity with increased phosphorylation of HCN1 by PKC leading to decreased HCN1 surface expression. New preliminary data using mass spectrometry techniques show that HCN1 channels are minimally phosphorylated at rest but undergo increased phosphorylation at S867 and S868 residues which are also phosphorylated in naive tissue under conditions of PKC activation. These data suggest that the earliest manifestation of HCN1 channels dysfunction during epileptogenesis is PKC-mediated loss of surface expression and concomitant loss of HCN1-mediated current (Ih).  Our goal in this R01 renewal application is to further understand the mechanisms of HCN1 channel dysfunction during the development of epilepsy. We propose to further study the phosphorylation signaling mechanisms underlying acute changes in HCN1 membrane trafficking after SE; determine whether these early events contribute to or initiate chronic HCN1 channelopathy; and characterize the effects of human HCN1 mutations on HCN1 channel biophysical properties. To do so we will use state-of-the-art techniques including: mass spectrometry; viral transduction of mutant HCN1 channel expression in vivo; cellular electrophysiology in the dendrites of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons; and analysis of a novel dataset of HCN1 mutations in a cohort of 800 children affected with epileptic encephalopathy of unknown cause.,337969

We recently began to explore the possibility that single-gene mutations in zebrafish can be used to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of DS. Zebrafish mutants featuring a loss-of- function sodium channel (SCN1A) mutation (e.g. a gene family commonly identified in children with DS) were identified and characterized by our laboratory as epileptic zebrafish with phenotypes similar to the human condition. Using automated behavioral tracking and in vivo electrophysiology assays we screened more than 1300 compounds using these fish. With the data generated we now propose to extend this research program to include novel DS zebrafish mutants additional high-throughput screening and mechanistic analysis of a small molecule lead compound that emerged from the first screening effort. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) to generate and characterize zebrafish DS mutants (ii) to perform high-throughput drug screening using zebrafish DS mutants and (iii) to examine the mechanism of action for clemizole in DS mutants. Techniques will include automated locomotion tracking in vivo zebrafish electrophysiology recording pharmacology CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium indicators. Our results promise to advance our long-term goal to better understand the pathophysiology of genetic epilepsies and identify promising new treatment options for these intractable conditions.,346719

In addition patients with genetic generalized epilepsy do not have the option of epilepsy surgery. The focus of this project is to explore the cellular and network basis of anti-epileptic drug response in genetic generalized epilepsy. The candidate has a strong clinical background in epilepsy and has developed significant preliminary work which forms the basis for the proposed research. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that interictal relative gamma power (30-100 Hz) may predict anti-epileptic drug response in absence epilepsy and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet Syndrome) due to the effect of these drugs on fast-spiking interneurons. The stargazer and tottering mouse models of epilepsy as well as the Scn1a heterozygous knock-in model of Dravet Syndrome are ideal for studying this hypothesis since they have mutations which have been associated with fast-spiking interneuron deficits and these interneurons are critical for the generation of neocortical gamma rhythms. In addition these models are known to have paradoxical seizure exacerbation with certain anti-epileptic drugs. In this project using in vivo 2-photon microscopy and simultaneous EEG post-hoc immunohistochemistry and in vivo video-EEG monitoring sampling at 2 kHz the specific aims of this project are to: (1) Determine the neocortical cell-specific and local network responses to anti-epileptic drugs in vivo in 3 models of genetic generalized epilepsy and (2) Evaluate the effect of anti-epileptic drugs on interictal EEG power between 2-300 Hz in vivo in the same 3 models of genetic generalized epilepsy. This proposal merges the techniques of computational analysis of EEG previously acquired under the mentorship of Sydney Cash MD PhD and more recent techniques acquired under the ongoing mentorship of Jeffrey Noebels MD PhD (primary mentor) who provides expertise in neurogenesis and Stelios Smirnakis MD PhD (co-mentor) who provides expertise in 2-photon imaging. In the short term the candidate has assembled a gap-based plan for rigorous training and coursework focusing on developing expertise in 2-photon imaging and patch-clamp techniques in vivo statistical modelling and analysis and translational research methodology while also learning about and treating patients with epilepsy in a clinical context. In the long term with a strong institutional commitment and abundant resources available in the Texas Medical Center this training will aid in the candidate's development as an independent clinician- scientist with a unique focus on diminishing pharmacoresistance in patients with epilepsy. Ultimately the completion of this research will shed new light on the mechanisms of genetic generalized epilepsy and can directly lead to improved drug development and patient care.,189832

DSsymptoms begin in infancy and lead to progressive developmental and behavioral impairments along withcharacteristic recurrent and varied seizures. In many patients seizures are resistant to currently availableantiepileptic drugs and uncontrolled seizure activity is associated with an increased incidence of SUDEP(sudden unexplained death in epilepsy). Thus there is a significant and urgent need for the development ofnovel drug therapies.SCN1A-containing Nav1.1 channels functionally oppose the related SCN8A-containing Nav1.6 channels. Wehave developed a novel therapeutic oligonucleotide candidate LSP-SCN8A that works by reducing levels ofSCN8A by directing its splicing to a non-functional isoform. LSP-SCN8A greatly reduces seizures andincreases lifespan in a mouse DS model.The goals of the Phase 1 portion of the study will be to perform neurophysiological characterization of LSP-SCN8A in DS mice by cellular electrophysiology and video-EEG. In the Phase 2 component we will performadditional dose-range studies for LSP-SCN8A in DS mice confirm splicing activity of LSP-SCN8A in humancells and generate a PD lot of the LSP-SCN8A SMO for non-GLP dose-finding studies in juvenile rats andprimates in preparation for formal GLP-toxicology studies. We will also prepare for and conduct the pre-INDmeeting with the FDA. The ultimate goal of our company is to fully develop LSP-SCN8A as a therapeutic totreat DS.,673232

We willassess the efficacy of the Nav1.6-specific sodium channel blocker XEN-A in Scn1a+/- mice a validated mousegenetic model of this devastating childhood epilepsy disorder. DS is caused by dominant heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene SCN1A encoding brain sodium channel Nav1.1. Our mouse genetic modelexhibits all facets of DS including thermally induced seizures spontaneous seizures premature deathhyperactivity severe cognitive impairment and autistic-like behaviors. These manifestations of DS are causedby selectively impaired action potential firing in GABAergic inhibitory neurons in hippocampus and cerebralcortex which alters the balance of excitation to inhibition in neural circuits in favor of excitation. DS miceprovide a unique resource to study the effects of XEN-A on a naturally occurring intractable epilepsy. Nav1.6 isthe primary sodium channel in excitatory neurons where it drives repetitive firing. It is a prime target for next-generation antiepileptic drugs but none have been tested in DS. As proof-of-principle we made DS mice thatwere heterozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in Nav1.6. These mice were much less susceptible toseizures and premature death supporting inhibition of Nav1.6 as a therapeutic strategy in DS. Drug discoveryresearch has yielded next-generation Nav1.6 inhibitors that are highly selective among sodium channel typesin sharp contrast to the nonselectivity of traditional sodium channel blockers that are not effective in DS. Wewill test the efficacy of a next-generation Nav1.6 drug (XEN-A Xenon Pharmaceuticals) in our mouse model ofDS. We hypothesize that Nav1.6-selective inhibitors will have potent antiepileptic effects in DS mice byspecifically inhibiting Nav1.6 in excitatory neurons in a voltage-dependent manner and will further havebeneficial effects on hyperactivity cognitive deficit and autistic-like behavior by re-balancing excitation andinhibition. We will test XEN-A on thermally induced seizures frequency and severity of spontaneous seizuresand premature death and cognitive and behavioral deficits including hyperactivity repetitive behaviorsimpaired spatial learning and memory and autistic-like behaviors. We will analyze seizure mechanisms in DSmice treated with XEN-A by electroencephalographic recording (EEG) and determine mechanism of action ofXEN-A in electrophysiological studies of neurons in brain slices. Our results could transform treatment ofpediatric epilepsies by identifying physiological mechanism(s) that render these seizures tractable and sopermit development of improved therapeutic strategies for control of intractable seizures. Determination of theunderlying mechanisms will provide a solid basis for the development of a new class of antiepileptic drugs tobenefit pediatric epilepsies broadly and may help to better understand key physiological processes that can betargeted to control intractable seizures.,233250

Nav1.6 is concentrated at the axon initial segment and nodes ofRanvier. Mutations of SCN8A affect many aspects of brain and peripheral nerve function. In 2012 wedescribed the first mutation of SCN8A in a child with early onset epileptic encephalopathy. Since then morethan 150 de novo missense mutations have been identified in this severe form of epilepsy (OMIM # 614558).Our functional characterization of 10 patient mutations demonstrated that gain-of-function mutations resultingin channel hyperactivity are the major pathogenic mechanism underlying SCN8A encephalopathy. Wegenerated a mouse model of the first identified SCN8A mutation p.Asn1768Asp that is widely used forevaluation of therapeutic interventions. We will use this model to isolate a recently discovered genetic modifierthat results in complete rescue of seizures and sudden death. We will also assess the pre-clinicaleffectiveness of antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi reagents that suppress the expression of the dominantSCN8A mutation in the N1768D mouse model. To explore the basis for the severe hypotonia associated withmany SCN8A mutations we have generated a new conditional mouse model with CRE-dependent expressionof the more severe patient mutation p.Arg1872Trp. We will use this new model to examine the role of mutantNav1.6 in specific subsets of neurons at varying stages of development.

The long term goal is to clarify mechanisms bywhich specific synaptic dysfunctions trigger neurological disorders. The objective in this application is to determine how mutations in Munc18-1 cause neuronal defects and to identify rescue strategies to reverse suchdeficits. Munc18-1 (also called STXBP1 SEC1 in yeast Rop in flies and unc18 in worms) controls neurotransmitter release at the synapse via binding to multiple effector proteins. Over 30 heterozygous de novo mu-tations have been identified in the Munc18-1 gene that cause the infantile epileptic encephalopathies Ohtahara West and Dravet syndrome but it is unknown how these mutations affect neurons and trigger three different diseases. The central hypothesis based on strong preliminary data is that mutations in Munc18-1 result indefects in its folding stability and localization and elicit same defects in wild-type Munc18-1. This loss of functional Munc18-1 subsequently impairs the function of its effectors and triggers synaptic dysfunction which canbe restored by stabilizing Munc18-1. The rationale for these studies is that understanding of how mutations inMunc18-1 trigger synaptic dysfunction in infantile epileptic encephalopathies will create opportunities for thedevelopment of novel therapies beyond the current limited symptom-based therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data this hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of disease-relevantmutations in Munc18-1 on protein stability; 2) Determine how Munc18-1 mutants affect the stability of its effectors and synapse function; and 3) Identify rescue strategies to stabilize Munc18-1 and restore its function. Under the first aim stability folding aggregation and intracellular targeting will be quantified for Munc18-1 wild-type and mutants combining purified recombinant proteins and primary neurons with biochemical and cell biological techniques. Under the second aim stability interaction and targeting of Munc18-1's effectors syntaxin-1 Doc2 Mint1 Mint2 and rab3 as well as synapse integrity and function will be analyzed using purified proteins primary neurons and in vivo mouse and worm models. Under the third aim chemical and molecularchaperones will be employed to restore deficits in Munc18-1 and in synapse structure and function usingsame paradigms as for aims 1 and 2. This research is significant because it will clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying Munc18-1-linked epilepsies and will have translational importance in the development of newrational treatments. This research is innovative because it 1) tests the novel hypothesis that Munc18-1 mutations cause synaptic dysfunction via a dominant-negative mechanism 2) uses a multidisciplinary and systematic approach that has not previously been used in this research area 3) is technically innovative because ofnewly generated C. elegans strains and 4) shifts focus from a symptom-centered perspective to an approachthat focusses on understanding convergent underlying disease mechanisms that pivot on Munc18-1.,358547

DS symptoms begin in infancy and lead to progressive developmental and behavioral impairmentsalong with characteristic recurrent and varied seizures. In many patients seizures are resistant to currentlyavailable antiepileptic drugs and uncontrolled seizures are associated with an increased incidence of SUDEP(sudden unexplained death in epilepsy). Thus there is a significant and urgent need for the development ofnovel drug therapies. SCN1A-containing Nav1.1 channels functionally oppose the related SCN8A-containing Nav1.6channels. Notably introducing an SCN8A LOF mutation into a SCN1A LOF DS mouse model will rescue theDS phenotype ameliorating seizures and early death. Therefore specifically reducing SCN8A-mediatedexcitation should rebalance the deficit of inhibitory input caused by SCN1A loss-of-function mutations andcause fewer adverse effects than sodium channel blockers which non-selectively antagonize multiple Na+channels. SCN8A subunits are naturally alternatively spliced to produce a non-functional isoform. Thus wedeveloped novel compounds called splice modulating oligonucleotides (SMOs) that direct SCN8A pre-mRNAsplicing to produce less functional isoforms of SCN8A protein. SMOs are a class of synthetic RNA basedcompounds that sterically block or weaken interactions between elements of the splice machinery and the pre-mRNA with exceptional potency specificity and negligible off-target effects at efficacious doses in CNS.SCN8A SMOs were designed in silico and refined for potency and specificity in vivo to identify two top SMOdrug candidates. Preliminary testing of both candidate SMOs in a DS mouse model with an SCN1A LOFmutation largely eliminated seizures during a critical period and robustly increased survival. From these twocandidates a lead SCN8A SMO will be selected to move forward into further pre-clinical testing. Non-GLP toxicology and pharmacodynamics testing will be performed in rats by the same intrathecal(i.t.) delivery method expected to be used in clinical trials. The single maximal tolerable dose (MTD) and noobserved adverse effects (NOAEL) will be determined followed by assessment of MTD and NOAEL at multipledoses (up to 4 weekly doses) and lastly studies to understand the duration of action at the MTD and NOAELdoses (Aim 1). Additional testing will be performed in DS mice to establish the MTD and the minimally effectiveSMO dose (MED) that reduces seizures improves survival and does not cause adverse motor effects orinduce anxiety behaviors associated with SCN8A knockdown in mice (Aim 2). These studies are designed tocontinue pre-clinical testing in preparation for formal GLP-toxicology studies. The ultimate goal is to develop anSCN8A SMO as potential therapeutic for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome.,185688

Despite the development of mouse models pathophysiological mechanisms for these disorders are poorly understood. One particularly devastating channelopathy is Dravet Syndrome (DS) a severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy typically caused by de novo dominant mutations in SCN1A encoding the voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) Nav1.1. Heterologous expression of mutant channels suggests haploinsufficiency raising the question of how loss of VGSCs underlying action potentials (APs) produces hyperexcitability. Data from DS mouse models indicate both decreased Na+ current in interneurons implicating disinhibition and increased Na+ current in pyramidal cells implicating hyperexcitability depending on genetic background brain area and animal age. To understand the effects of SCN1A DS mutations in human neurons we derived forebrain-like neurons from two DS subjects by induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming of patient fibroblasts and compared them with iPSC-derived neurons from human controls. We found that DS patient-derived neurons have increased Na+ current density in both bipolar- and pyramidal-shaped neurons. Consistent with increased Na+ current both putative excitatory and inhibitory patient-derived neurons showed spontaneous bursting and other evidence of hyperexcitability. Our data provided some of the first evidence that epilepsy patient-specific neurons obtained via the iPSC method are useful for modeling epileptic-like hyperactivity. Moreover our findings revealed a previously unrecognized potential epilepsy mechanism underlying DS and offered a platform for future screening of novel anti-epileptic therapies using patient-derived neurons. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular basis of genetic epilepsies. Our objective is to determine epilepsy mechanisms of SCN1A-linked DS in humans. We will test the central hypothesis that SCN1A haploinsufficiency leads to paradoxically increased Na+ current in excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as alterations in other ionic currents that underlie neuronal hyperexcitability in DS. The rationale fr this work is that identifying the role of SCN1A haploinsufficiency in the development of hyperexcitability may lead to novel treatments for DS as well as related pediatric epilepsies. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1: To determine whether SCN1A haploinsufficiency causes alterations in the expression of other VGSC -subunits that lead to increased Na+ current in DS patient-specific iPSC neurons. 2: To investigate changes in synaptic function in DS patient-specific iPSC neurons. 3: To determine the electrophysiological characteristics of DS patient-specific and control iPSC neurons differentiated in the rodent brain.This work is expected to reveal how SCN1A haploinsufficiency contributes to epilepsy in humans. Our results will have positive impact because this work will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of DS and related diseases and may lead to novel therapeutic agents for epilepsy.,555221

While the majority of DS cases are linked to SCN1A haploinsufficiency SCN1Bhomozygous mutations are also linked to DS. Scn1b-/- mice have a DS phenotype with SUDEP. SCN1Bencodes VGSC 1 subunits which are developmentally regulated cell adhesion molecules and ion channelmodulators that play critical roles in the regulation of excitability. Scn1b-/- mice have cell type specific changesin Na+ (INa) and K+ (IK) currents. In addition Scn1b-/- mice have neuronal proliferation migration andpathfinding defects at postnatal day (P)5 that precede seizure onset at ~P10. These data suggested thatalterations in CAM function may contribute to hyperexcitability however new data challenge this idea and offerthe alternative explanation that defective cell adhesion in SCN1B-linked DS may not contribute to seizures butinstead impact other co-morbidities. Preliminary data show that Scn1b-/- mice also have delayed maturation ofneuronal Cl- gradients such that GABAergic signaling remains depolarizing and excitatory until ~P17-18 whichmay contribute to hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The objective of this work is to understand themechanism of hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The central hypothesis is that the mechanism ofhyperexcitability in the Scn1b-/- model of DS is cell type specific changes in INa IK and GABAergic signaling.Further it is proposed that human SCN1B-DS mutations result in loss-of-function with similar defects in ioniccurrents and delayed maturation of GABAergic signaling as observed in Scn1b-/- neurons. The experimentalplan will test three Aims: 1. To determine the mechanism of hyperexcitability resulting from Scn1b deletion; 2.To determine whether human SCN1B-linked DS mutations result in loss-of-function in mouse models; 3. Todetermine the phenotype of SCN1B-linked DS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons.Model choice is key to understanding epilepsy mechanisms. Importantly mice are not small humans. Thuspatient-derived iPSC neuronal models provide essential information regarding human disease. On the otherhand mature brain networks cannot yet be replicated using iPSCs and so brain slice preparations fromtransgenic mouse models remain important to understanding circuitry. Rather than relying on a single modelthis project will compare and contrast human and mouse models to understand key mechanistic aspects of thedevelopment of hyperexcitability in DS. Even though SCN1B-linked DS is rare compared to SCN1A-linkeddisease this work may lead to the discovery of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in DS caused bymultiple types of gene mutations.,653145

Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the voltage-gatedsodium channel  subunit gene SCN1A (encoding the protein Nav1.1) are associated with multiple forms oftreatment-resistant epilepsy including Dravet syndrome (DS) a catastrophic early-life encephalopathy. As 70-80% of cases of DS can be attributed to a reduction in functional Nav1.1 strategies that can increase SCN1Atranscription from the wild-type allele are predicted to improve patient outcomes. Despite the important role ofSCN1A in epilepsy and more broadly in the normal regulation of neuronal excitability little is currently knownabout the machinery underlying the regulation of SCN1A transcription. Therefore we are limited in our ability todevelop strategies to increase SCN1A transcription. We identified three predicted Functional GenomicElements (FGEs) within the SCN1A locus that significantly increased reporter activity in a dual luciferaseassay: FGE2 FGE17 and FGE23. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that FGE2 FGE17 and FGE23endogenously act as transcriptional enhancer elements for SCN1A. We will use the Synergistic ActivationMediator (dCas9SAM) system to localize transcriptional activators to these FGEs in neuronal cell culture.Previous studies have shown that localizing transcriptional activators to gene promoters or enhancers can elicitan increase in gene expression making dCas9SAM a powerful tool for evaluating putative regulatory elements.Additionally we will perform ATAC-seq on GABAergic interneurons which preferentially express SCN1A in aneffort to identify additional FGEs that contribute to SCN1A transcriptional regulation. Our preliminary data alsoshow that the minor allele of the epilepsy-associated SNP rs6732655 located in SCN1A intron 16significantly decreases reporter activity in a dual luciferase assay compared to the major allele. In Aim 2 wewill test the hypothesis that the rs6732655 minor allele introduces a silencer element thereby reducing SCN1Aexpression. We will examine SNP allele-dependent protein-binding in order to identify candidate factors thatbind to the minor allele. We will also knock-in the minor allele of this SNP to SH-SY5Y human neuroblastomacells to evaluate the endogenous impact on SCN1A expression. Our long-term goal is to translate thesefindings into clinically-relevant strategies for increasing Nav1.1 levels thereby providing new therapeuticoptions.,229388

In most cases (>80%) DS is linked to mutations ingenes which encode voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) subunits SCN1A and SCN1B whichencode the Nav1.1  subunit and the VGSC 1 subunit respectively. SCN1A and SCN1B areexpressed in both brain and heart. 1 regulates gating and kinetics of the ion channel porefunctions as a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) and initiates cell signaling. In ventricular myocytesphosphorylated 1 localizes to intercalated disks and associates with the tetrodotoxin (TTX)-insensitive VGSC  subunit Nav1.5 while non-phosphorylated 1 localizes to t-tubules where itassociates with the TTX-sensitive VGSC  subunits Nav1.1 Nav1.3 and Nav1.6. We proposethe high incidence of SUDEP in DS patients results from neuronal hyperexcitability and cardiacarrhythmia due to expression of mutant VGSC subunits in brain and heart. Scn1b null mice modelDS. Scn1b null mice display prolonged QT intervals by electrocardiogram abnormal calciumhandling that is sensitive to TTX and increased transient and persistent sodium currents inacutely isolated ventricular myocytes. Scn1b null mice show increased expression of Scn3a andScn5a encoding Nav1.3 and Nav1.5 respectively.  subunits are substrates for sequentialcleavage by -site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and -secretase. Sequential cleavagegenerates a soluble intracellular domain (ICD). We hypothesize that 1 cleavage in heartfollowed by 1-ICD translocation to the nucleus is critical for the transcriptional regulation ofVGSC  subunits and potentially other genes important in regulating cardiac excitability. When1 is not functional as in DS 1-mediated transcriptional regulation and 1-mediated currentmodulation are disrupted resulting in changes in excitability and arrhythmias. Understanding themechanism of 1-mediated signal transduction in heart may lead to new methods for theidentification and treatment of patients at risk of SUDEP.,36023

Characterized as an infantile-onset epilepsy that leads to severe autistic-like cognitiveimpairment with high rates of sudden unexplained death (SUDEP) DS is caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in SCN1A encoding the type 1 voltage-gated sodium channel. Although a mechanistic basisof the syndrome remains poorly understood studies using animal models strongly suggest that Scn1a mutationsselectively impair PV and SST inhibitory interneurons and conditional deletion of Scn1a in forebrain interneuronswas previously shown to fully recapitulate the epileptic phenotype. This selective impairment of interneuronsmakes DS a promising target for the development of therapy based on transplantation of exogenousinterneurons which can migrate long distances from the injection site and integrate synaptically with surroundingcortical interneurons (INs) within host brain. This unique ability has driven the successful use of interneuronsderived from fetal tissue to treat acquired epilepsy in rodent models. However it remains unclear whether arodent model of a genetic epilepsy can be treated effectively with interneurons that are derived from stem cellsa more clinically applicable viable alternative to fetal cells. Additionally while the physiological roles ofendogenous PV and SST cells are relatively well established it remains unknown how engrafted PV- and SST-fated precursors mature and influence host activity. To address these important questions we will study theeffect of transplants at the level of single cells circuits and whole animals. We hypothesize that mouseembryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived interneuron transplants will synaptically integrate into the epilepticbrain of DS mice improve circuit-level disinhibition in vitro and suppress seizures in vivo. In aim 1 I willuse whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute brain slices to determine whether transplanted PV andSST interneuron transplants demonstrate intrinsic maturity and influence host activity at the level of interneuronsubtype-specific microcircuits. In aim 2 I will assess the inhibitory influence of transplants in vivo by first usingoptogenetics and calcium imaging to assess inhibition of endogenous excitatory neurons and then assessingthe transplants effect on seizures in DS mice.,44524

Recent pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggests that cannabidiol (CBD) may provide an effective tolerable alternative to current therapeutics however its mechanism of action is unclear. In this study I will examine a newly described proposed target for cannabidiol and examine potential pathways by which CBD controls seizure activity at the synaptic systems and in vivo level.,NINDS,9597594,12/3/2018 0:00,PA-14-150,5F30NS100293-03,5,F30,NS,100293,3, ,"KLEIN, BRIAN",12/12/2016 0:00,12/11/2020 0:00,NST-2 Study Section [NST-2], ,11443627,"ROSENBERG, EVAN CORY",Not Applicable,12,NEUROLOGY,121911077,M5SZJ6VHUHN8,121911077,M5SZJ6VHUHN8,US,40.669895,-73.974354,5998304,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10016,UNITED STATES,N,12/12/2018 0:00,12/11/2019 0:00,853,"Training, Individual",2019,45016, ,NINDS,45016, , ,This proposal focuses on examining the mechanism of cannabidiol (CBD) a non-psychoactive component of cannabis with documented anti-seizure effects in several pre-clinical studies(1 2) and a recent double-blinded multicenter phase III clinical trial in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy(3 4). Despite centuries of clinical usage the mechanism of action of CBD remains ambiguous. Further exploring the pharmacology of CBD may provide benefit to the 1/3 of epilepsy patients with seizures resistant to current treatments (10).  In one leading hypothesis CBD acts as a competitive antagonist at the G-protein coupled receptor GPR55 inhibiting binding of a membrane phospholipid lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). CBD blocks LPI- mediated increases in presynaptic Ca2+ and vesicular release thus reducing excitability at axon terminals (12). However the function of LPI-GPR55 signaling at inhibitory synapses as well as potential postsynaptic effects remains to be explored.  Using a multidisciplinary approach with ex vivo whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and in vitro immunocytochemistry and molecular biology I discovered that LPI had unique effects at excitatory and inhibitory synapses both at the pre- and postsynapse. At 5-10 minutes post application LPI increased the frequency of vesicular release in CA1 hippocampus consistent with previous reports of presynaptic locus of GPR55 action(12). However contrary to prior studies I identified prominent GPR55 staining in the cell bodies of CA1 pyramidal neurons and a postsynaptic LPI effect of increased GluA1 AMPAR expression at 50-60 minutes post application. I also determined that LPI reduced inhibitory postsynaptic strength in part by reducing GABAAR 2 subunit expression. Taken together these results suggest that LPI increases the excitatory / inhibitory ratio in hippocampal neuronal networks by a dual mechanism: enhancing excitatory transmission and attenuating inhibition. This predicts that CBD by opposing LPI action may exert its beneficial anti-seizure effects on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses through actions at GPR55. I plan to explore these possibilities by repeating these experiments with CBD pre-treatment and GPR55-/- mice as controls.  To supplement these experiments at the circuit level I plan to investigate how LPI and CBD regulate evoked transmission and short-term plasticity in CA3-CA1 hippocampal circuits. At the in vivo level I will use both acute and chronic seizure models to determine seizure susceptibility in GPR55-/- mice. Based on surprising preliminary results I discovered that seizure activity upregulates GPR55 membrane expression producing a biomarker for prolonged seizures and potentiating the effects of LPI. In all as part of this fellowship I propose to combine my clinical training and scientific experience to elucidate the mechanisms of this intriguing therapeutic target for epilepsy and help stratify subpopulations for targeted treatment.,45016

Therapy that improves function of defective interneurons is notavailable. Structural development and maintenance of interneurons is dependent on trophic support providedby brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation of TrkB receptors. In the undercut (UC) model ofepileptogenic neocortical injury chronic activation of TrkB-Rs with a selective small molecule partial agonist(LM22A-4 LM below) has long-term effects to reverse structural and functional abnormalities in inhibitoryterminals of PV interneurons enhance GABA release and increase the threshold for evoking epileptiformactivity and seizures. In order to determine whether these effects will be applicable to treatment or preventionof epilepsy in other models with different causes for seizures such as genetic epilepsies the Dravet syndrome(DS) mouse will be used in some experiments. Decreases in a membrane sodium channel in PV interneuronsin DS mice causes decreased release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA and development of spontaneousand high temperature-induced seizures. A variety of experimental approaches in DS and UC mice will be usedto determine whether chronic treatment with LM by increasing GABA release from nerve terminals of SOMand PV interneurons or inducing new inhibitory synapse formation will enhance inhibition in cortical networksand suppress epileptiform discharges: 1) immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging will be used to assessalterations in PV and SOM presynaptic terminals including changes in expression of VGAT- and GAD65/67-IR and the calcium sensor protein synaptotagmin 2; 2) analysis of density of SOM/- and PV/gephyrin closeappositions to test for new inhibitory synapse formation induced by TrkB activation; 3) electrophysiologicalanalysis of basic properties of inhibitory synaptic transmission from PV interneurons to pyramidal neurons of invitro slices to detect effects of TrkB activation on unitary IPSCs release probability and transmission failures;3) laser scanning photostimulation of cortical slices from PV/CHR2 and SOM/CHR2 mice to map thedistribution and strength of inhibitory connectivity in neocortical inhibitory circuits; and 4) video/EEG monitoringof implanted mice to assess effects of treatment with LM on spontaneous seizures and hyperthermia-inducedseizures. Results of these experiments will provide information about mechanisms leading from interneuronalabnormalities to development of epilepsy and a potential approach to prophylaxis of epileptogenesis byenhancing trophic support of interneurons.,344378

Symptoms in severe childhoodepilepsies such as Dravet syndrome (DS) are not limited to seizures but typically involve increased anxietyautism spectrum disorder intellectual disability and circadian and sleep disorders. Most treatments forepilepsies target seizure severity and frequency but do not necessarily focus on remaining symptomswhich greatly diminish the quality of life of patients and caregivers. In this proposal we test the hypothesisthat improving circadian and sleep regulation in DS will not only result in decreased seizure frequency andseverity but also in an improvement of other symptoms of the disease. To test predictions of this hypothesiswe capitalize on a mouse model of DS. As DS patients DS mice have a heterozygous loss-of-functionmutation in the SCN1A gene which codes for the primary voltage-gated Na+ channel in adult GABAergicneurons. DS mice show most symptoms of the disease including febrile and spontaneous seizuresincreased anxiety autistic behavior cognitive deficits and dysregulation of circadian rhythms and sleep.Thus DS mice represent a reliable genotypic and phenotypic model of the disease. Here we propose toincrease the 24-h temporal structure of the environment to improve both circadian and homeostaticregulation of sleep and in turn to determine whether these improvements result in reduced seizure severityand frequency reduced anxiety improved social behavior and cognitive performance.Aim 1 will assess the ability of wheel-running restriction to the dark phase food restriction to the dark phaseor a combination of both routines to improve behavioral physiological and molecular circadian rhythms toincrease sleep hygiene and to reduce seizure frequency in both male and female DS mice. Aim 2 willdetermine whether the best routine in improving these outcomes will be also effective in reducing anxietyincreasing social behavior and improving memory consolidation.Until now most treatments of childhood epilepsies including DS involve pharmacological treatments thatseek to reduce seizure severity and frequency. Many of these treatments are ineffective in treating DS andthe development of non-pharmacological non-invasive treatments that improve symptoms holistically offersgreat promise to improve the quality of life of DS patients as well as patients with other forms of severeepilepsy. Our proposal exploits a reliable animal model of DS to test potential treatments that because oftheir minimal invasiveness could be implemented in DS patients.,77750

We have developed a mouse genetic model withall the features of DS including susceptibility to thermally induced seizures and spontaneous seizures ataxia circadianrhythm and sleep disorders cognitive deficit autistic-like behaviors and premature death. All these effects are correlatedwith loss of Na currents and excitability of GABAergic interneurons which causes imbalance of excitation vs. inhibitionin neural circuits. Mutation of Nav1.1 channels specifically in forebrain GABAergic interneurons by the Cre-Lox methodis sufficient to cause the major DS symptoms confirming that DS is caused by loss of Nav1.1 channels in inhibitoryneurons. Remarkably cognitive deficit and autistic-like behaviors of DS mice can be rescued by treatment with a lowdose of the GABA-A receptor co-activator clonazepam demonstrating that these life-changing co-morbidities are causedby the mutation of Nav1.1 channels rather than by neuronal damage from recurrent seizures. Our central questions noware: (i) Which inhibitory neuron types are involved in epilepsy and cognitive deficits? (ii) When does mutation of Nav1.1in these neurons cause DS? (iii) Where are vulnerable interneurons located? (iv) Can novel combinations of drugs preventboth seizures and cognitive deficit in DS mice? (v) Will drug combinations retain efficacy in chronic use withouttolerance? In order to address these crucial questions we will use cell-specific gene deletion with the Cre-Lox methodtimed gene deletion with tamoxifen-induced Cre recombinase and local deletion by stereotaxic injection of virallyexpressed Cre to further dissect the interneuron types developmental timing and brain locations in which mutation ofNav1.1 causes epilepsy in DS. Electrophysiological studies will reveal deficits in cellular excitability that cause DS. Wewill develop optogenetic approaches to induce and rescue epilepsy in DS mice by local expression of ArchChannelrhodopsin and new generations of optogenetic probes in specific classes of inhibitory neurons. We will assess thepotential dysfunction of the `dentate gate' in generating seizures in DS mice. In order to understand cognitive deficit inDS we will use a similar gene deletion strategy to determine the interneuron types developmental timing and brainlocation in which deletion of Nav1.1 channels cause cognitive deficit and we will measure induction and rescue ofcognitive deficit with the context-dependent fear conditioning and Barnes maze tests. Electrophysiological studies in brainslices and intact mice will identify the deficits in cellular excitability and circuit function that cause cognitive deficit in DSmice. Based on our emerging understanding of epilepsy and cognitive deficit in DS mice we will develop noveltherapeutic approaches combining cannabidiol for treatment of seizures with a low dose of a benzodiazepine such asclonazepam clobazam or a next-generation drug to rescue cognitive deficits. We will determine the physiologicalmechanisms responsible for therapeutic effects of optimal drug combinations and we will develop long-term treatmentmethods to assess and prevent development of tolerance. Overall our results will give crucial new insights into thepathophysiology of DS and provide novel but practical approaches to therapy of this disastrous disease.,424672

The most common diagnoses that increase risk for SDY include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy coronary artery anomalies of wrong sinus origin arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ion channelopathies and genetic forms of epilepsy such as Dravet Syndrome.  In up to 30% of cases of SDY no specific diagnosis is found (autopsy negative).  Sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been documented at all ages and may be associated with competitive athletics.  Approximately 10-15% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases may be due to ion channelopathies.  Similarly sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been documented at all ages and several risk factors have been identified including some cases originating with ion channelopathies.  Noncompliance of antiepileptic medication usage and polytherapy in patients with refractory epilepsy are also risk factors for SUDEP. The Sudden Death in the Young (SDY) Initiative is a two-phase program to explore and provide greater understanding of SDY.  The second phase of the program will support scientific research through the use of the registry data and DNA samples using the NIH grant mechanism.  The second phase of the program will run concurrently with the SDY Registry.,57165

Animalmodels are increasingly used to understand disease mechanisms and to screen promising therapeuticapproaches. Animal epilepsy model use typically requires expensive and labor-intensive experimentation withinvasive EEG measurements being the preferred method of validation. This severely limits the pace and scale ofinvestigation. In models of acquired epilepsy animals usually undergo treatment to induce status epilepticusa period of unremitting seizurefollowed by a latent period during which the brain rewires itself to generatespontaneously recurring seizures evidence of chronic epilepsy. The duration of the latent period and thelikelihood that an animal will develop epilepsy are both uncertain. Animals must be observed for weeks toconfirm epilepsy before they are ready for experimentation. During this latent period seizures are commonlydocumented by visual observation or video review which are tedious and prone to error. A commercial systemfor automated noninvasive seizure detection would therefore be attractive to epilepsy researchers.Signal Solutions LLC has developed technology based on piezoelectric sensors for noninvasive high-throughput behavioral monitoring of rodents that is currently used by research groups around the world toidentify genes related to sleep and circadian rhythms. The system discriminates sleep from wakefulness withover 90% accuracy. The Sunderam Lab at the University of Kentucky has further demonstrated using EEGanalysis that these piezo sensors can be used to label REM and NREM stages of sleep in mice.In this STTR proposal PI Sunderam and co-investigator Bauer will work with Signal Solutions to developmethods based on the piezo technology for accurate noninvasive seizure screening in rodent models ofepilepsy. The result will be a validated system that minimizes the need for invasive and resource-intensive EEGanalysis or tedious video monitoring. The objectives of the project are the following: 1. Test the feasibility ofcoarse detection of epilepsy onset in rodents using a noninvasive piezo sensor; 2. Train a piezo classifier toaccurately detect and quantify seizures in rodents with confirmed epilepsy; and 3. Test the utility of a miniaturepiezo sensor for seizure screening and an infrared imager for seizure verification and severity assessment.The envisioned product is a turnkey system for convenient and noninvasive seizure screening in small animalmodels of epilepsy in custom or commercial cages. Potential customers include academic research labs as wellas labs in the pharmaceutical sector engaged in high-volume screening of antiepileptic drugs.,227455

The multiplicity of causes of the disease poses an obvious challenge to the development of a general therapeutic approach. Even when epilepsy is caused by a single gene alteration such as in Dravet syndrome in humans the changes in the activity of the affected neurons can be too severe to be successfully targeted by the existing drugs. Our findings revealed a novel signaling control mechanism that has a major potential for the treatment of epilepsy. The ability of the brain-enriched microRNA miR-128 to modulate the activity of signaling networks that include many of the epilepsy-linked signaling proteins points to a potential use of a miR-128 based therapy for epilepsy treatment.,NINDS,9535510,8/24/2018 0:00,PA-13-302,5R01NS091574-04,5,R01,NS,91574,4, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",9/1/2015 0:00,8/31/2020 0:00,"Neurotransporters, Receptors, and Calcium Signaling Study Section[NTRC]", ,9344236,"SCHAEFER, ANNE ",Not Applicable,13,NEUROSCIENCES,78861598,C8H9CNG1VBD9,78861598,C8H9CNG1VBD9,US,40.790284,-73.946781,3839801,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,100296574,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2018 0:00,8/31/2020 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2018,369434, ,NINDS,218750,150684, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current project addresses a novel regulatory mechanism of neuronal activity by microRNAs and its role in controlling animal behavior and epilepsy. We found that a neuron-enriched microRNA miR-128 acts as a negative master modulator of neuronal signaling responses in mice. The importance of the miR-128 in brain function is underscored by the development of fatal epileptic seizures in mice that lack miR-128 in postnatal forebrain neurons. Accordingly overexpression of miR-128 in neurons attenuates chemically-induced seizures and rescues survival in mice. These findings reveal miR-128 as a previously unknown key regulator of neuronal activity with a potential for the development of novel anti-epileptic therapeutic approaches. The major regulatory function of miR-128 highlights the importance of the mechanisms that control miR-128 expression levels as well as miR-128 access to its targets in neurons. We found that calcineurin/NFAT activity an important signaling pathway in neuronal development and function controls miR-128 expression in neurons. Most importantly mice with neuronal calcineurin deficiency develop a fatal seizure syndrome similar to the one observed in mice with miR-128 deficiency. These findings provided a strong indication for the role of calcineurin/NFAT signaling in control of miR-128 expression. The mechanism of calcineurin/NFAT-mediated regulation of miR-128 expression will be addressed in this proposal. The proposal also addresses a novel mechanism of regulation of miR-128 effector function. Preliminary data suggest that access of miR-128 to its mRNA targets is regulated by miR-128-sequestring non-coding decoy RNAs. This novel mechanism of regulation of miR-128 effector function will be explored in experiments using unique mouse models with inactivation or overexpression of the neuron-specific miR-128 decoy RNAs in combination with the molecular electrophysiological and behavioral approaches that have been established in our laboratory. The central role of miR-128 in neuronal signaling makes this miRNA an attractive target for potential therapeutic intervention of epilepsy. Using a mouse model of the human Dravet syndrome one the most severe and often treatment resistant forms of epilepsy the proposal will explore the therapeutic potential of neuronal miR-128 modulation for the treatment of the disease. To bring the research closer to the development of actual antiepileptic therapy we will explore the antiepileptic potential of exogenously expressed miR-128. MiR-128 will be delivered to defined neurons using neurotrophic adeno-associated viruses (AAV) that are currently considered as the most reliable vehicle for in vivo gene delivery in mice and human. In summary our proposal describes highly innovative and hypothesis driven studies of a novel non-coding RNA mechanism for controlling neuronal signaling and activity that has a strong potential to be applied for the treatment of human epilepsy.,369434

Until now there has not been an organized clinical network specifically focused on individuals at high risk for SUDEP. Moreover there is a lack of unified clinical monitoring algorithms that will stratify SUDEP risk i patient population allow in-depth correlative analysis with brain morphometric studies and genetic investigations and inform model systems of premature epilepsy mortality. We therefore propose a Clinical Network Core (SRA-CNC) that consists of four principal components: (1) a Pediatric Clinical Network (PCN) aimed at recruitment physiological monitoring and sample collection in children affected by Dravet syndrome (2) an Adult Clinical Network (ACN) focused on high SUDEP risk adult patients based on the combined phenotype of epilepsy cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory dysfunction (3) Analysis Center entails physiological morphometric and epidemiological evaluations of the human data and (4) Data integration and storage. The SRA-CNC will perform four main functions; (1) It will establish infrastructure logistical and regulatory support and implement standard operating procedures for case ascertainment scope and mode of physiological monitoring and data collection and procurement of biological specimens; (2) it will provide problem focused expert analysis of the (i) clinical and epidemiological data (ii) ictal cardiac and respiratory physiology and (iii) imaging based morphometry; (3) It will optimize resource utilization and facilitate data exchange analysis and communication among participating centers; and (4) SRA-CNC will translate investigational procedures into clinical practice in the form of public education and evidence driven recommendations. The Clinical Network Core is an essential component of the proposed SUDEP Center Without Wall piloted by the investigators of SUDEP Research Alliance as it will inform and facilitate current and future research translational projects in humans and i the individualized model systems.,160889

Although SUDEP is the most devastating consequence of epilepsy and the leading cause of epilepsy mortality astonishingly little is understood about its causes and no biomarkers exist to identify at risk epilepsy patients. To advance our understanding of these critical issues we will focus on Dravet Syndrome (DS) a severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy associated with a high SUDEP incidence. DS is most frequently caused by mutations in the voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) gene SCN1A encoding NaV1.1. As NaV1.1 is expressed in brain heart and peripheral nerves a compelling idea is that altered Na+ currents (INa) in DS cardiac myocytes (CMs) or autonomic neurons in addition to central neurons lead to arrhythmias and SUDEP. We used the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) method to derive central and peripheral neurons and CMs from fibroblasts of DS subjects. Preliminary data from DS patient CMs suggest that a subset of DS subjects shows abnormal CM INa and excitability. In studies of a DS human mutant SCN1A knock-in mouse model we observed spontaneous seizures and SUDEP increased ventricular CM INa density and ventricular arrhythmias at the time of SUDEP. Similarly we found increased ventricular CM INa density spontaneous seizures and SUDEP in a Scn1b null DS mouse model. Our work studies of Scn1a heterozygous null DS mice and clinical ECG studies in DS also show altered cardiac autonomic function. Thus we hypothesize that SUDEP in DS is caused by VGSC mutations that produce cardiac electrical and/or autonomic dysfunction in addition to brain dysfunction. Furthermore that combined insights from studies of DS patient-derived cells mouse models and patient peri-ictal ECG data will yield biomarkers of SUDEP risk in DS.  Four specific aims will test these hypotheses: 1) To understand the effects of DS-linked SCN1A mutations on cardiac excitability using DS patient iPSC-derived CMs and DS mice; 2) To determine how DS-linked SCN1A mutations influence the excitability of autonomic neurons cardiac autonomic innervation and autonomic control of cardiac function using DS patient iPSC-derived autonomic neurons and DS mice; 3) To investigate changes in autonomic excitability in a second mouse model of DS Scn1b null mice and in SCN1B-DS patient iPSC CMs and neurons; and 4) To determine whether cardiac electrical and/or autonomic function is altered in DS patients at baseline or peri-ictally. Our wor will synergize with the entire CWOW proposal to not only uncover SUDEP mechanisms in DS but also to provide advances in understanding SUDEP causes and biomarkers that will be applicable to other refractory epilepsies due to ion channelopathies and perhaps other etiologies. This work will also show proof-of-principle for the use of multiple platforms (cellularand clinical data from the same patients and multiple mouse models) to individualize SUDEP risk and develop patient-specific preventative treatments.",666500

The neural bases for sleep disorders in DS are unknown in part because until recently there were no animal models for this disease. The main goal of this grant is to study the mechanisms underlying these sleep disorders using a recently developed mouse model of DS.,NINDS,9532954,8/2/2018 0:00,PA-13-302,5R01NS094211-04,5,R01,NS,94211,4, ,"HE, JANET",9/1/2015 0:00,8/31/2019 0:00,"Neuroendocrinology, Neuroimmunology, Rhythms and Sleep Study Section[NNRS]", ,8146532,"DE LA IGLESIA, HORACIO O",Not Applicable,7,BIOLOGY,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2018 0:00,8/31/2019 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2018,337969, ,NINDS,218750,119219, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Animals carrying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the Scn1a gene (Scn1a+/- mice) which encodes a subunit of the voltage-gated Na+ channel NaV1.1 show deficits in both homeostatic regulation of sleep and circadian regulation of rest-activity cycles. The NaV1.1 channel is the primary voltage-gated Na+ channel in adult GABAergic interneurons and its reduced activity results in a decrease of GABAergic tone suggesting that sleep regulatory deficits in Scn1a+/- mice emerge from reduced GABAergic activity. However Scn1a+/- mice are a model of a severe form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome (DS) and as DS patients show not only dysregulation of sleep but also generalized seizures. Epileptic activity complicates the interpretation of sleep disorders in DS as sleep regulatory deficits could be the result of sleep disruption by seizures or of seizure-associated neural damage. Our hypothesis is that sleep disorders in DS are the consequence of reduced GABAergic tone within sleep regulatory centers that is independent of the presence of seizures. To address this hypothesis we propose to conditionally target the Scn1a+/- mutation to specific neurons and brain regions. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether sleep abnormalities in global Scn1a+/- mice emerge from the effect of the mutation specifically on GABAergic neurons. We will target the Scn1a+/- mutation to these cells using an Scn1alox/- mouse and a Cre driver mouse line that targets GABAergic neurons throughout the brain and will assess the integrity of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep in these mutants. This approach will unequivocally determine whether sleep regulatory deficits in Scn1a+/- mice are the result of reduced NaV1.1 channel activity within GABAergic cells or whether non- GABAergic cells that express the channel also contribute to this phenotype. Specific Aim 2 will target the Scn1a+/- mutation to cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) the site of the central circadian pacemaker that regulates sleep. Viruses expressing Cre recombinase targeting either all SCN cells or specifically vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-containing cells will be injected wihin the SCN of Scn1alox/+ mice. We will also target the mutation to the SCN VIPergic cells by crossing Scn1alox/+ mice with a mouse line in which the VIP promoter drives the expression of Cre. Because VIP neurons are essential for the integrity of the SCN oscillatory network we expect that these VIP-specific Scn1a+/- mutants will show similar effects to mutants in which all SCN cells are targeted. Specific Aim 3 will virally target the Scn1a+/- mutation to the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RNT) which is essential for the generation of slow-wave sleep and spindles during non- REM sleep both compromised in Scn1a+/- mice. None of the conditional mutant approaches in Aims 1 and 2 is expected to induce seizures offering a unique opportunity to assess the effect of reduced NaV1.1 channel activity in sleep regulatory regions in the absence of seizures. We predict that the conditional targeting of the Scn1a+/- mutation to the SCN and RNT will lead to deficits in circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep respectively. These results would provide direct support for the role of the NaV1.1 channel within these brain regions in the regulation of sleep. They would also directly support our hypothesis that both circadian and homeostatic sleep deficits in DS emerge from seizure-independent reduced GABAergic activity in specific brain regions providing new avenues for the treatment of sleep disorders in DS.,337969

Cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory depression are both proposed to be mechanisms that lead to SUDEP however respiratory mechanisms have not been studied as extensively as cardiac causes. This proposal seeks: 1) to investigate the mechanisms underlying hypoventilation and post-ictal coma; 2) to identify biomarkers; 3) to aid forensic diagnosis and; 4) to discover preventive interventions to decrease SUDEP.,NINDS,9531450,8/24/2018 0:00,RFA-NS-14-004,5U01NS090414-05,5,U01,NS,90414,5, ,"LEENDERS, MIRIAM",9/30/2014 0:00,7/31/2019 0:00,ZNS1-SRB-B(40), ,1882821,"RICHERSON, GEORGE B",Not Applicable,1,NEUROLOGY,62761671,Z1H9VJS8NG16,62761671,Z1H9VJS8NG16,US,41.664405,-91.542152,3972901,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,IOWA CITY,IA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,522421320,UNITED STATES,N,8/1/2018 0:00,7/31/2019 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2018,705839, ,NINDS,477082,228757, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy estimated to account for up to 50% of all deaths in this population and up to 17% of deaths in all patients with epilepsy. There is a surprisingly common lack of awareness among patients and physicians of this increased risk of sudden death. In a recent survey only 56% of Canadian pediatricians who treat patients with epilepsy knew their patients were at increased risk for sudden death and only 33% of these physicians knew the term SUDEP. There is controversy regarding whether cardiac failure or respiratory arrest is more important as the primary cause of death but cardiac and respiratory data is rarely collected simultaneously from human cases of SUDEP or from mouse models. For example in the more than 20 documented cases of SUDEP that occurred while the patient was undergoing EMU monitoring none of these patients had measurements of ventilation or even blood oxygenation. Effective preventive strategies in high-risk epileptic patients will rely on defining the mechanisms that lead from seizures to death. Our preliminary data suggest that respiratory depression is the primary cause of death in some cases of SUDEP and that patients with Dravet syndrome have previously uncharacterized breathing abnormalities in the peri-ictal period. Furthermore our data has indicated there is an anatomical pathway that inhibits ventilation which extends from the amygdala and anterior temporal lobe to medullary nuclei that control breathing. However it is unclear how this circuit is connected and the identities of the neurons involved. In Aim 1 we will characterize peri-ictal cardiorespiratory control in human patients with Dravet syndrome as well as mouse models of this pathology. In Aim 2 we will define the anatomical pathway from the amygdala to the brainstem that inhibits the cardiovascular and respiratory control networks during seizures. Finally in Aim 3 we will determine the identity of brainstem neurons that receive inputs from the amygdala and inhibit breathing and consciousness during seizures. This work will identify an anatomical pathway by which cortical seizures can invade the midbrain and brainstem and cause depressed cardiorespiratory function and arousal. Our findings have the potential to characterize key components of this circuit and may identify biomarkers that can be used to develop effective screening strategies. Better understanding mechanisms that underlie SUDEP will allow future development of preventative treatments that may decrease SUDEP risk.,705839

Nav1.6 is concentrated at the axon initial segment and nodes ofRanvier. Mutations of SCN8A affect many aspects of brain and peripheral nerve function. In 2012 wedescribed the first mutation of SCN8A in a child with early onset epileptic encephalopathy. Since then morethan 150 de novo missense mutations have been identified in this severe form of epilepsy (OMIM # 614558).Our functional characterization of 10 patient mutations demonstrated that gain-of-function mutations resultingin channel hyperactivity are the major pathogenic mechanism underlying SCN8A encephalopathy. Wegenerated a mouse model of the first identified SCN8A mutation p.Asn1768Asp that is widely used forevaluation of therapeutic interventions. We will use this model to isolate a recently discovered genetic modifierthat results in complete rescue of seizures and sudden death. We will also assess the pre-clinicaleffectiveness of antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi reagents that suppress the expression of the dominantSCN8A mutation in the N1768D mouse model. To explore the basis for the severe hypotonia associated withmany SCN8A mutations we have generated a new conditional mouse model with CRE-dependent expressionof the more severe patient mutation p.Arg1872Trp. We will use this new model to examine the role of mutantNav1.6 in specific subsets of neurons at varying stages of development. This conditional model will also beused to directly test the contribution of cardiac expression of hyperactive Nav1.6 to the risk of sudden death.These studies will provide new knowledge regarding pathogenic mechanisms underlying SCN8Aencephalopathy and will test the effectiveness of gene suppression as a therapeutic intervention for thissevere neurological disorder.,440550

Over 800 mutations in SCN1A encoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 have been reported patients. SCN1A mutations are associated with epilepsy phenotypes on the genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) spectrum. The GEFS+ spectrum ranges from simple febrile seizures on the mild end of the spectrum to Dravet syndrome on the severe end. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A result in Dravet syndrome an infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by a variety of seizure types developmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variable expressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by genetic modifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) model a number of features of Dravet syndrome including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reduced sodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons which is predicted to increase excitability due to failure of inhibition. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is stronglydependent on strain background. Scn1a+/- mice on the resistant 129 strain background (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrast Scn1a+/- mice on a (129xB6)F1 strain background (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality with 50% dying by 1 month of age. Based on the strain- dependent difference in phenotype we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severity. We recently mapped several modifier loci that influence premature lethality of Scn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal we will perform fine mapping and candidate gene analysis with the goal of identifying the responsible modifier genes. In addition to the strain-dependent differences in clinical severity we also observed strain-dependent differences in hippocampal neuron sodium currents (INa). GABAergic interneurons isolated from the F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased INa density compared to wildtype littermate controls. In contrast INa density is preserved in GABAergic interneurons isolated from 129.Scn1a+/- and is no different from wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for the loss of Nav1.1 while F1 interneurons do not. Based on this observation we hypothesize that there are strain differences in compensatory capacity in the context of Scn1a heterozygous deletion. We propose to perform RNA-seq analysis to characterize hippocampal transcriptome differences during the critical phase of phenotype onset in susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant 129.Scn1a+/- mice. The results of this analysis will suggest candidate modifier genes and pathways that influence phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Identification of Dravet syndrome modifier genes will provide insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and will suggest novel therapeutic strategies for the improved treatment of human patients.,337969

In most children febrile seizures occur as isolated events but in some children with a geneticpredisposition febrile seizures occur frequently and can rapidly progress to afebrile (spontaneous) seizures.The goal of my research is to show that fever depresses synaptic inhibition which drives the onset of febrileseizures and that additional alterations occur within select inhibitory circuits to then drive the onset of afebrileseizures.,NINDS,9505709,4/5/2018 0:00,PAR-16-220,1K22NS105922-01,1,K22,NS,105922,1, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",6/1/2018 0:00,5/31/2020 0:00,ZNS1-SRB-M(04), ,12145617,"ANTOINE, MICHELLE ",Not Applicable,12,MISCELLANEOUS,124726725,GS3YEVSS12N6,124726725,GS3YEVSS12N6,US,37.870017,-122.268624,577502,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,BERKELEY,CA,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,947101749,UNITED STATES,N,6/1/2018 0:00,5/31/2019 0:00,853,Other Research-Related,2018,78300, ,NINDS,72500,5800, ,The research proposal is focused on deciphering the mechanisms causing febrile and afebrile seizuresespecially in cases of genetically linked epileptic encephalopathies such as Dravet syndrome. A specific short-term goal is to understand how fever interacts with genetics to increase seizure susceptibility. In the long-termI aim to incorporate genetic circuit and systems approaches to identify the causal mechanisms underlyingautism and epilepsy. To achieve my goals I have developed a 2-year training plan for learning advancedphysiology techniques such as in vivo whole-cell recordings two-photon calcium imaging and electroenceph-alogram recordings. These new skills will help expand my expertise into epilepsy research and provide astrong platform to build my independent research program. This training plan is rich in career developmentactivities that will provide essential avenues for me to optimize my skills in mentoring students writing papersand presenting scientific talks. In research during Phase I I will build on my preliminary findings which showthat temperatures within the fever range can decrease parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneuron-mediatedfeedforward inhibition a process I refer to as fever-induced depression of inhibition (FIDI). My aims aretherefore focused on establishing whether there is a causal link between FIDI and seizures in multiple mousemodels of febrile seizures and during the early postnatal stages of interneuron development. To complete thework during the mentored phase I have assembled a panel of experts that includes my mentor Dr. DanielFeldman an expert in neurophysiology and my scientific advisors Dr. Yang Dan a leader in the field of corticalneurophysiology Dr. Daniela Kaufer an expert in epileptogenesis mechanisms and finally AristeaGalanopoulou a clinical board certified epileptologist and neurophysiologist. The combination of this excellentadvisory team as well as the outstanding facilities provided by UC Berkeley will ensure that I make significantprogress towards my research and career goals. This training plan lays the groundwork for research to bedone during Phase II. The first research goal of Phase II is to establish causal roles for PV-mediated inhibitionin promoting both febrile and afebrile seizures. Specifically in a first aim I will test whether febrile and afebrileseizures can be blocked or delayed by chemo-genetically up-modulating local PV interneuron firing rates. I willalso examine the cellular and synaptic mechanisms in PV interneurons that could underlie FIDI. In a secondaim I will use chronic two-photon calcium imaging to characterize the temporal dynamics of network activitychanges within the pyramidal neurons and multiple interneuron cell populations during the period betweenfebrile and spontaneous seizure onset. This aim will identify the vulnerable timeframe when intervention maybe successful in hindering the progression from febrile to afebrile seizures. As a whole the work of Phase Iand Phase II will delineate potential synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlying the onset of febrile andafebrile seizures and will prepare me for a successful transition to becoming an independent investigator.,78300

However treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate because many patients suffer fromuncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the fasterdevelopment of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typicallyrequires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjectivescoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale ofbehavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective inexpensive and automatedphenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on therecent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales thatare arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules and the transitions betweenthem can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assistedanalytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsyresearch in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) duringinter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models and under various experimentalconditions. In addition we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only theovertly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodiumchannel -subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice) but also distinguish the seemingly normal non-epilepticSCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have apotentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated objectiveuser-independent inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes.,237423

Equally devastating intellectual and behavioraldisabilities severely disrupt quality of life for patients and caregivers and have no effective therapy. Classicallyintellectual impairments have been considered a direct effect of uncontrolled seizures and research has beentargeted at improving seizure control. Recent work in systems neurophysiology suggests that specific patternsof brain activity so-called brain rhythms underlie cognition and that disruption of these rhythms impairsintellectual ability. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether loss-of-function mutations inScn1a are sufficient to disrupt SWR and whether spatial memory is impaired in parallel. To determine whetherseizures contribute to spatial memory impairment to determine whether restoration of Scn1a expression withgene therapy recovers normal SWR features and improves spatial memory we will use existing DS mousemodels and generate a novel DS model in which Scn1a expression can be recovered in a previously affectedmouse a genetic `cure'.

Current drug therapies are ineffective at controlling seizures and no therapy exists forsevere cognitive deficits. While seizure frequency and severity often improves children with DS who surviveinto their teenage years have IQs in the severely impaired range 50 to 70 and typically require permanentinstitutional or family care. Therapy for cognitive impairment would dramatically improve the lives of thesepatients substantially reduce long-term care costs and reduce accidental deaths. Work in genetic mousemodels which are faithful genocopies and phenocopies shows that inhibitory interneuron but not excitatorycell activity is impaired resulting in an in-balance between excitation and inhibition the likely cause of seizuresand co-morbidities. An emerging principle from systems-level neuroscience is that cognition depends onprecisely timed electrophysiologic patterns brain rhythms. Whether disrupted brain rhythms contribute tocognitive impairment in human disease and whether interventions targeted at normalization of rhythmsthrough pharmaceuticals targeted stimulation or via correction of genetic defect are a reasonable therapeuticstrategy remains to be determined. Hippocampal sharp - wave / ripple (SWR) complexes contribute to spatiallearning and memory and require high frequency temporally precise action potential firing in inhibitoryinterneurons. We hypothesize that: Decreased SWR recurrence and slowed intra-ripple frequency arecaused by hippocampal interneuron hypoexcitability and contribute to spatial memory impairment inDS mice. The proposed experiments will: (1) extend the preliminary finding of decreased ripple recurrence andslowed intra-ripple frequency in DS mice comparing SWR features by sleep-wake state and during context-dependent spatial learning to determine if rate of SWR occurrence and intra-ripple frequency are correlatedwith Scn1a expression and memory performance (2) determine whether spatial memory impairment ismediated through effects of reduced Scn1a expression reduced Na current and hypoexcitability of forebrainGABAergic interneurons (3) determine whether seizures contribute to spatial memory impairment and alteredSWR features and (4) determine whether altered SWR features and impaired spatial memory can benormalized with restoration of Na channel expression. This work will be organized around the following specificaims: Aim 1: Dependence of SWR recurrence intra-ripple frequency and spatial memory impairmenton Scn1a expression Aim 2: Contribution of seizures to reduced SWR occurrence slowed intra-ripplefrequency and spatial memory impairment,337969

Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have treatment resistant (refractory) seizures thereby presenting a major clinical challenge and burden. The most common form of refractory epilepsy is mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) characterized by spontaneous seizures neuropsychological deficits and hippocampal sclerosis. At present surgical resection of the epilepsy focus is the best treatment strategy for this disorder; however this procedure is only used in a subset of cases. Consequently there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatments.  Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) SCN1A SCN2A and SCN3A are associated with several epilepsy subtypes including Dravet syndrome (DS) and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Gain of function mutations in the VGSC SCN8A have recently identified in individuals with epileptic encephalopathies. However our laboratory has demonstrated that mice with Scn8a mutations that reduce channel activity or expression are more resistant to induced seizures when compared to their wild-type littermates. In addition we were able to dramatically ameliorate seizure severity and restore normal lifespans to Scn1a mutants that model DS and GEFS+ by either co-segregation of an Scn8a mutation or hippocampal knockdown of Scn8a expression. Since the hippocampus is the major site of seizure generation and morphological changes in MTLE we hypothesize that selective reduction of SCN8A expression in the hippocampus will provide an effective strategy for the treatment of MTLE. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will establish the effect on spontaneous seizure frequency and severity of reducing hippocampal Scn8a expression in the widely used intra-hippocampal kainic acid mouse model of MTLE. Reduced Scn8a expression will be achieved by hippocampal injection of an adeno-associated viral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA against Scn8a (AAV-3). Seizure activity will be monitored in AAV-3 treated mice using continuous video/EEG analysis and will be compared to control mice injected with a scrambled construct (AAV-GFP). In Aim 2 we will determine if hippocampal reduction of Scn8a expression could also prevent or ameliorate the changes in behavior and hippocampal morphology and that are observed in this model of MTLE. Finally in Aim 3 we compare the biophysical properties of hippocampal slices from the AAV-3 and AAV-GFP treated mice in order to directly examine neuronal excitability. We will also test if partial pharmacological block of Nav1.6 using novel compounds can reduce seizure-like bursting activity in hippocampal slices from the MTLE mouse model and we will explore the contribution of the different VGSCs to the development of MTLE. This clinically relevant proposal will provide important insight into the feasibility of targeting SCN8A as a treatment for MTLE and more broadly for other forms of refractory epilepsy.,466679

Thus this research is relevant to the NIH's mission that pertains tosupporting the ongoing basic research foster research that has immediate medical relevance and encouragetranslational research that links the discoveries from basic research into therapeutic interventions for treatingneurological disorders such as epilepsy.,NINDS,9470925,1/29/2018 0:00,PA-16-160,5R01NS102181-02,5,R01,NS,102181,2, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",4/15/2017 0:00,2/28/2022 0:00,Therapeutic Approaches to Genetic Diseases Study Section[TAG], ,10571121,"BURRE, JACQUELINE ",Not Applicable,12,NEUROLOGY,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,US,40.7607,-73.9603,1514803,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,100654805,UNITED STATES,N,3/1/2018 0:00,2/28/2019 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2018,358904, ,NINDS,218750,140154, ,Mutations in Munc18-1 are associated with three infantile epileptic encephalopathies but the mechanistic relationship between mutations and these diseases is unknown. The long term goal is to clarify mechanisms bywhich specific synaptic dysfunctions trigger neurological disorders. The objective in this application is to determine how mutations in Munc18-1 cause neuronal defects and to identify rescue strategies to reverse suchdeficits. Munc18-1 (also called STXBP1 SEC1 in yeast Rop in flies and unc18 in worms) controls neurotransmitter release at the synapse via binding to multiple effector proteins. Over 30 heterozygous de novo mu-tations have been identified in the Munc18-1 gene that cause the infantile epileptic encephalopathies Ohtahara West and Dravet syndrome but it is unknown how these mutations affect neurons and trigger three different diseases. The central hypothesis based on strong preliminary data is that mutations in Munc18-1 result indefects in its folding stability and localization and elicit same defects in wild-type Munc18-1. This loss of functional Munc18-1 subsequently impairs the function of its effectors and triggers synaptic dysfunction which canbe restored by stabilizing Munc18-1. The rationale for these studies is that understanding of how mutations inMunc18-1 trigger synaptic dysfunction in infantile epileptic encephalopathies will create opportunities for thedevelopment of novel therapies beyond the current limited symptom-based therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data this hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of disease-relevantmutations in Munc18-1 on protein stability; 2) Determine how Munc18-1 mutants affect the stability of its effectors and synapse function; and 3) Identify rescue strategies to stabilize Munc18-1 and restore its function. Under the first aim stability folding aggregation and intracellular targeting will be quantified for Munc18-1 wild-type and mutants combining purified recombinant proteins and primary neurons with biochemical and cell biological techniques. Under the second aim stability interaction and targeting of Munc18-1's effectors syntaxin-1 Doc2 Mint1 Mint2 and rab3 as well as synapse integrity and function will be analyzed using purified proteins primary neurons and in vivo mouse and worm models. Under the third aim chemical and molecularchaperones will be employed to restore deficits in Munc18-1 and in synapse structure and function usingsame paradigms as for aims 1 and 2. This research is significant because it will clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying Munc18-1-linked epilepsies and will have translational importance in the development of newrational treatments. This research is innovative because it 1) tests the novel hypothesis that Munc18-1 mutations cause synaptic dysfunction via a dominant-negative mechanism 2) uses a multidisciplinary and systematic approach that has not previously been used in this research area 3) is technically innovative because ofnewly generated C. elegans strains and 4) shifts focus from a symptom-centered perspective to an approachthat focusses on understanding convergent underlying disease mechanisms that pivot on Munc18-1.,358904

Along with severe seizures children with DS have developmental and learning difficultiesand increase risk for epilepsy-related death. Thus we have developed a novel compound thatprevented seizure and death in a DS mouse model and we are moving forward with pre-clinicaltesting in the current proposal towards GLP-toxicology studies.,NINDS,9466176,1/18/2018 0:00,PA-16-302,1R43NS105291-01,1,R43,NS,105291,1, ,"CAPORELLO, EMILY LAURA",2/1/2018 0:00,1/31/2020 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-ETTN-A(11)B], ,1896708,"TALLENT, MELANIE K",Not Applicable,6,Unavailable,965376994,ZWZRCWKUDYH8,965376994,ZWZRCWKUDYH8,US,39.924054,-75.70946,10028008,"LIFESPLICE PHARMA, LLC",Kennet Square PA 19348,PA,Domestic For-Profits,193551423,UNITED STATES,N,2/1/2018 0:00,1/31/2019 0:00,853,SBIR/STTR,2018,389793, ,NINDS,260209,104084, ,Dravet Spectrum disorders resulting from SCN1A loss-of-function (LOF) mutations include febrileseizures generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus (GEFS+) and Dravet Syndrome (DS) in order ofseverity. DS symptoms begin in infancy and lead to progressive developmental and behavioral impairmentsalong with characteristic recurrent and varied seizures. In many patients seizures are resistant to currentlyavailable antiepileptic drugs and uncontrolled seizures are associated with an increased incidence of SUDEP(sudden unexplained death in epilepsy). Thus there is a significant and urgent need for the development ofnovel drug therapies. SCN1A-containing Nav1.1 channels functionally oppose the related SCN8A-containing Nav1.6channels. Notably introducing an SCN8A LOF mutation into a SCN1A LOF DS mouse model will rescue theDS phenotype ameliorating seizures and early death. Therefore specifically reducing SCN8A-mediatedexcitation should rebalance the deficit of inhibitory input caused by SCN1A loss-of-function mutations andcause fewer adverse effects than sodium channel blockers which non-selectively antagonize multiple Na+channels. SCN8A subunits are naturally alternatively spliced to produce a non-functional isoform. Thus wedeveloped novel compounds called splice modulating oligonucleotides (SMOs) that direct SCN8A pre-mRNAsplicing to produce less functional isoforms of SCN8A protein. SMOs are a class of synthetic RNA basedcompounds that sterically block or weaken interactions between elements of the splice machinery and the pre-mRNA with exceptional potency specificity and negligible off-target effects at efficacious doses in CNS.SCN8A SMOs were designed in silico and refined for potency and specificity in vivo to identify two top SMOdrug candidates. Preliminary testing of both candidate SMOs in a DS mouse model with an SCN1A LOFmutation largely eliminated seizures during a critical period and robustly increased survival. From these twocandidates a lead SCN8A SMO will be selected to move forward into further pre-clinical testing. Non-GLP toxicology and pharmacodynamics testing will be performed in rats by the same intrathecal(i.t.) delivery method expected to be used in clinical trials. The single maximal tolerable dose (MTD) and noobserved adverse effects (NOAEL) will be determined followed by assessment of MTD and NOAEL at multipledoses (up to 4 weekly doses) and lastly studies to understand the duration of action at the MTD and NOAELdoses (Aim 1). Additional testing will be performed in DS mice to establish the MTD and the minimally effectiveSMO dose (MED) that reduces seizures improves survival and does not cause adverse motor effects orinduce anxiety behaviors associated with SCN8A knockdown in mice (Aim 2). These studies are designed tocontinue pre-clinical testing in preparation for formal GLP-toxicology studies. The ultimate goal is to develop anSCN8A SMO as potential therapeutic for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome.,389793

We recently found thatin vivo ABHD6 inhibition decreases seizure incidence in several mouse models of epilepsy and that thistherapeutic response does not undergo tolerance nor does it produce overt side effects. These resultssuggest that ABHD6 inhibition might represent a novel anti-epileptic therapeutic approach. In this R21 grant proposal we will test the therapeutic efficacy of a novel inhibitor of ABHD6 KT-182 inScn1a+/- mice a preclinical mouse model of Dravet Syndrome that accurately mimics this devastatingintractable epilepsy that begins in infancy. Our hypothesis is that ABHD6 inhibition will significantly reduceseizure severity in Scn1a+/- mice without producing overt side effect and tolerance. To test this hypothesis wewill address three aims: 1. Effect of ABHD6 inhibition on thermally-induced seizures 2. Effect of ABHD6 inhibition on spontaneous seizures and premature death 3. Effect of ABHD6 inhibition on EEG and neuronal excitabilityThe results gathered through this R21 grant will provide a solid foundation for future research aimed atdeveloping ABHD6 inhibitors as new therapeutics for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome. This research willalso increase our basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which endogenous 2-AG signallingcontrols synaptic transmission and seizure incidence.,194219

Childhood epileptic encephalopathies are the most severe form of epilepsy with onset in early childhood multiple seizure types that are difficult to treat and poor developmental outcomes. There is considerable evidence that genetic mutations cause childhood epileptic encephalopathies and our recent research has identified several new genetic causes. However most cases are still not explained. This research will identify new genes and genetic pathways in epilepsy. Furthermore we will study the specific genetic changes disrupt normal brain function. Our results and will directly benefit individuals with epilepsy and their families through improved diagnostic prognostic and recurrence risk information. Greater understanding of the genes involved in normal development and function of the brain will facilitate improved therapies for this common disorder and benefit society as a whole.,NINDS,9455793,5/1/2018 0:00,PA-11-260,5R01NS069605-08,5,R01,NS,69605,8, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",2/15/2010 0:00,3/31/2020 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-GGG-A(90)S], ,2048128,"MEFFORD, HEATHER C.",Not Applicable,7,PEDIATRICS,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,4/1/2018 0:00,3/31/2019 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2018,636555, ,NINDS,412010,224545, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting as many as 1 in 26 individuals. The childhood epileptic encephalopathies (CEE) are the most severe types of epilepsy characterized by refractory seizures cognitive arrest or regression associated with ongoing epileptic activity and a poor prognosis. Identifying the genetic causes of CEE is the initial step toward developing more effective diagnostic tests prognosis counseling and treatments. Despite significant advances in gene discovery in recent years the majority of patient with CEE remain undiagnosed. Our recent work (R01NS069605) to investigate the genetic basis of epilepsy helped establish the role of copy number variants (CNVs) in CEE. More recently we use a high-throughput targeted sequencing strategy to screen 73 known and candidate CEE genes for mutations in a cohort of >500 CEE probands identifying pathogenic mutations in >10% of patients. Our studies identified CHD2 and SYNGAP1 as novel and important causes of CEE GRIN2A as a cause of epilepsy-aphasia syndromes and GABRA1 and STXBP1 as causes of a subset of SCN1A- negative Dravet syndrome. In this proposal we build upon these successes and propose three lines of investigation. First we will use trio exome sequencing in 150 patients with CEE who have already been screened for mutations in a large number of CEE genes and are therefore enriched for gene discovery. Second we will use high-throughput targeted of a panel of CEE and ID genes to investigate the role of these genes in several related neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Finally we will investigate the role of the chromatin remodeling pathway in epileptogenesis highlighted by the discovery of CHD2 mutations in a subset of CEE patients. Successful completion of our aims will lead to improved genetic diagnosis of patients better prognosis and recurrence risk counseling for families and novel targets for development of therapeutics.,636555

Ion channel dysfunction is widely believed to form the basis of both inherited and acquired forms of epilepsy. This study will examine possible mechanisms causing dysfunction of the HCN1 ion channel both after acquired insults to the brain and in a recently identified human genetic epilepsy syndrome.,NINDS,9447220,3/6/2018 0:00,PA-13-302,5R01NS050229-11,5,R01,NS,50229,11, ,"CHURN, SEVERN BORDEN",7/1/2005 0:00,3/31/2021 0:00,Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section[CNNT], ,1861785,"POOLOS, NICHOLAS P",Not Applicable,7,NEUROLOGY,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,4/1/2018 0:00,3/31/2019 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2018,337969, ,NINDS,218750,119219, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are voltage-gated ion channels that modulate excitability in several brain regions involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy including the hippocampus neocortex and thalamus. Accumulated evidence shows that downregulation of Ih the current generated by HCN channels causes neuronal hyperexcitability and that genetic deletion of HCN1 channels the main cortical and hippocampal subtype accelerates the rate of epileptogenesis in acquired epilepsy models. More recent evidence shows that mutations in HCN1 underlie early life epileptic encephalopathy in some children with severe epilepsy and developmental delay. Thus HCN1 channelopathy occurs in both human genetic epilepsy and animal models of acquired epilepsy.  In recent work from our laboratory epilepsy induced by chemoconvulsant-induced status epilepticus (SE) was associated with loss of HCN1 channel expression that began within 1 hour post-SE and persisted into chronic epilepsy. HCN1 channels were acutely internalized from the surface membrane of hippocampal pyramidal dendrites within the first hour following SE well before the onset several days later of transcriptional downregulation of HCN1 mRNA expression. We now show for the first time that HCN1 channel surface expression is governed in a bidirectional fashion by protein kinase C (PKC) activity with increased phosphorylation of HCN1 by PKC leading to decreased HCN1 surface expression. New preliminary data using mass spectrometry techniques show that HCN1 channels are minimally phosphorylated at rest but undergo increased phosphorylation at S867 and S868 residues which are also phosphorylated in naive tissue under conditions of PKC activation. These data suggest that the earliest manifestation of HCN1 channels dysfunction during epileptogenesis is PKC-mediated loss of surface expression and concomitant loss of HCN1-mediated current (Ih).  Our goal in this R01 renewal application is to further understand the mechanisms of HCN1 channel dysfunction during the development of epilepsy. We propose to further study the phosphorylation signaling mechanisms underlying acute changes in HCN1 membrane trafficking after SE; determine whether these early events contribute to or initiate chronic HCN1 channelopathy; and characterize the effects of human HCN1 mutations on HCN1 channel biophysical properties. To do so we will use state-of-the-art techniques including: mass spectrometry; viral transduction of mutant HCN1 channel expression in vivo; cellular electrophysiology in the dendrites of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons; and analysis of a novel dataset of HCN1 mutations in a cohort of 800 children affected with epileptic encephalopathy of unknown cause.,337969

While the majority of DS cases are linked to SCN1A haploinsufficiency SCN1B homozygousmutations are also linked to DS. The objective of this work is to understand the mechanism of hyperexcitabilityin human SCN1B-linked DS.

Most concerning are the severe seizures and high risk of suddenunexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Mutations in voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC)  and  subunitgenes are linked to DS. While the majority of DS cases are linked to SCN1A haploinsufficiency SCN1Bhomozygous mutations are also linked to DS. Scn1b-/- mice have a DS phenotype with SUDEP. SCN1Bencodes VGSC 1 subunits which are developmentally regulated cell adhesion molecules and ion channelmodulators that play critical roles in the regulation of excitability. Scn1b-/- mice have cell type specific changesin Na+ (INa) and K+ (IK) currents. In addition Scn1b-/- mice have neuronal proliferation migration andpathfinding defects at postnatal day (P)5 that precede seizure onset at ~P10. These data suggested thatalterations in CAM function may contribute to hyperexcitability however new data challenge this idea and offerthe alternative explanation that defective cell adhesion in SCN1B-linked DS may not contribute to seizures butinstead impact other co-morbidities. Preliminary data show that Scn1b-/- mice also have delayed maturation ofneuronal Cl- gradients such that GABAergic signaling remains depolarizing and excitatory until ~P17-18 whichmay contribute to hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The objective of this work is to understand themechanism of hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The central hypothesis is that the mechanism ofhyperexcitability in the Scn1b-/- model of DS is cell type specific changes in INa IK and GABAergic signaling.Further it is proposed that human SCN1B-DS mutations result in loss-of-function with similar defects in ioniccurrents and delayed maturation of GABAergic signaling as observed in Scn1b-/- neurons. The experimentalplan will test three Aims: 1. To determine the mechanism of hyperexcitability resulting from Scn1b deletion; 2.To determine whether human SCN1B-linked DS mutations result in loss-of-function in mouse models; 3. Todetermine the phenotype of SCN1B-linked DS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons.Model choice is key to understanding epilepsy mechanisms. Importantly mice are not small humans. Thuspatient-derived iPSC neuronal models provide essential information regarding human disease. On the otherhand mature brain networks cannot yet be replicated using iPSCs and so brain slice preparations fromtransgenic mouse models remain important to understanding circuitry. Rather than relying on a single modelthis project will compare and contrast human and mouse models to understand key mechanistic aspects of thedevelopment of hyperexcitability in DS. Even though SCN1B-linked DS is rare compared to SCN1A-linkeddisease this work may lead to the discovery of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in DS caused bymultiple types of gene mutations.,651415

We recently began to explore the possibility that single-gene mutations in zebrafish can be used to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of DS. Zebrafish mutants featuring a loss-of- function sodium channel (SCN1A) mutation (e.g. a gene family commonly identified in children with DS) were identified and characterized by our laboratory as epileptic zebrafish with phenotypes similar to the human condition. Using automated behavioral tracking and in vivo electrophysiology assays we screened more than 1300 compounds using these fish. With the data generated we now propose to extend this research program to include novel DS zebrafish mutants additional high-throughput screening and mechanistic analysis of a small molecule lead compound that emerged from the first screening effort. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) to generate and characterize zebrafish DS mutants (ii) to perform high-throughput drug screening using zebrafish DS mutants and (iii) to examine the mechanism of action for clemizole in DS mutants. Techniques will include automated locomotion tracking in vivo zebrafish electrophysiology recording pharmacology CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium indicators. Our results promise to advance our long-term goal to better understand the pathophysiology of genetic epilepsies and identify promising new treatment options for these intractable conditions.,346719

In addition patients with genetic generalized epilepsy do not have the option of epilepsy surgery. The focus of this project is to explore the cellular and network basis of anti-epileptic drug response in genetic generalized epilepsy. The candidate has a strong clinical background in epilepsy and has developed significant preliminary work which forms the basis for the proposed research. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that interictal relative gamma power (30-100 Hz) may predict anti-epileptic drug response in absence epilepsy and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet Syndrome) due to the effect of these drugs on fast-spiking interneurons. The stargazer and tottering mouse models of epilepsy as well as the Scn1a heterozygous knock-in model of Dravet Syndrome are ideal for studying this hypothesis since they have mutations which have been associated with fast-spiking interneuron deficits and these interneurons are critical for the generation of neocortical gamma rhythms. In addition these models are known to have paradoxical seizure exacerbation with certain anti-epileptic drugs. In this project using in vivo 2-photon microscopy and simultaneous EEG post-hoc immunohistochemistry and in vivo video-EEG monitoring sampling at 2 kHz the specific aims of this project are to: (1) Determine the neocortical cell-specific and local network responses to anti-epileptic drugs in vivo in 3 models of genetic generalized epilepsy and (2) Evaluate the effect of anti-epileptic drugs on interictal EEG power between 2-300 Hz in vivo in the same 3 models of genetic generalized epilepsy. This proposal merges the techniques of computational analysis of EEG previously acquired under the mentorship of Sydney Cash MD PhD and more recent techniques acquired under the ongoing mentorship of Jeffrey Noebels MD PhD (primary mentor) who provides expertise in neurogenesis and Stelios Smirnakis MD PhD (co-mentor) who provides expertise in 2-photon imaging. In the short term the candidate has assembled a gap-based plan for rigorous training and coursework focusing on developing expertise in 2-photon imaging and patch-clamp techniques in vivo statistical modelling and analysis and translational research methodology while also learning about and treating patients with epilepsy in a clinical context. In the long term with a strong institutional commitment and abundant resources available in the Texas Medical Center this training will aid in the candidate's development as an independent clinician- scientist with a unique focus on diminishing pharmacoresistance in patients with epilepsy. Ultimately the completion of this research will shed new light on the mechanisms of genetic generalized epilepsy and can directly lead to improved drug development and patient care.,189832

Cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory depression are both proposed to be mechanisms that lead to SUDEP however respiratory mechanisms have not been studied as extensively as cardiac causes.

There is a surprisingly common lack of awareness among patients and physicians of this increased risk of sudden death. In a recent survey only 56% of Canadian pediatricians who treat patients with epilepsy knew their patients were at increased risk for sudden death and only 33% of these physicians knew the term SUDEP. There is controversy regarding whether cardiac failure or respiratory arrest is more important as the primary cause of death but cardiac and respiratory data is rarely collected simultaneously from human cases of SUDEP or from mouse models. For example in the more than 20 documented cases of SUDEP that occurred while the patient was undergoing EMU monitoring none of these patients had measurements of ventilation or even blood oxygenation. Effective preventive strategies in high-risk epileptic patients will rely on defining the mechanisms that lead from seizures to death. Our preliminary data suggest that respiratory depression is the primary cause of death in some cases of SUDEP and that patients with Dravet syndrome have previously uncharacterized breathing abnormalities in the peri-ictal period. Furthermore our data has indicated there is an anatomical pathway that inhibits ventilation which extends from the amygdala and anterior temporal lobe to medullary nuclei that control breathing. However it is unclear how this circuit is connected and the identities of the neurons involved. In Aim 1 we will characterize peri-ictal cardiorespiratory control in human patients with Dravet syndrome as well as mouse models of this pathology. In Aim 2 we will define the anatomical pathway from the amygdala to the brainstem that inhibits the cardiovascular and respiratory control networks during seizures. Finally in Aim 3 we will determine the identity of brainstem neurons that receive inputs from the amygdala and inhibit breathing and consciousness during seizures. This work will identify an anatomical pathway by which cortical seizures can invade the midbrain and brainstem and cause depressed cardiorespiratory function and arousal. Our findings have the potential to characterize key components of this circuit and may identify biomarkers that can be used to develop effective screening strategies. Better understanding mechanisms that underlie SUDEP will allow future development of preventative treatments that may decrease SUDEP risk.,66617

Clinical observations andanimal studies suggest that seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) is the primary event leading to SUDEP.Although current studies implicate serotonin (5-HT) (also adenosine) in S-IRA it is unclear if otherneurotransmitters contribute to S-IRA and how these neurotransmitters modulate S-IRA. These gaps inknowledge have significantly hindered the development of effective prevention strategies against SUDEP.Monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain such as 5-HT norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) arearousal-promoting and may stimulate breathing. In our preliminary and published studies in the DBA/1 mousemodel we determined that pharmacologic elevation of 5-HT or NE levels and optogenetic stimulation of 5-HT-mediated arousal suppress S-IRA. Thus in this high risk and high impact proposal we hypothesize thatenhanced monoamine-mediated arousal prevents seizure-induced sudden death in mice. We will testthis hypothesis in two separate SUDEP mouse models the DBA/1 mouse and the Dravet mouse that exhibitsthe salient features of Dravet syndrome (a type of epilepsy) in humans including spontaneous seizures. Inspecific aim 1 we will determine if pharmacologic enhancement of monoamine function reduces S-IRA and/orsudden death in both DBA/1 and Dravet mice. We will examine if 5-HT NE and DA are implicated in seizure-related mortality using monoamine reuptake inhibitors and identify the specific serotonergic adrenergic anddopaminergic receptors that are involved in prevention of seizure-related mortality. In specific aim 2 we willdetermine if selective stimulation of the dorsal raphe locus coeruleus or ventral tegmental area reduces S-IRAin both DBA/1 and Dravet mice. We will use optogenetics to activate the monoaminergic brain nuclei that areknown to mediate arousal response and examine if enhancing arousal mediated by each monoaminesuppresses S-IRA. If successful the proposed studies could lead to significant conceptual advance in themechanisms of SUDEP and foster development of novel pharmacologic and neurostimulatory strategiesagainst SUDEP. Completion of the proposed studies will establish animal models and methodology for furtherdissecting the neuronal circuitry investigating the interaction and elucidating the cellular mechanisms ofmonoamines involved in seizure-related mortality.,194003

The disorder results from haploinsufficiency of SCN1A a neuronal voltage-gatedsodium channel gene. The encoded channel Nav1.1 is an abundant sodium channel in the mammaliannervous system. We propose to investigate the reversibility of prenatal and early postnatal effects of Scn1ahaploinsufficiency using a mouse model that recapitulates seizures behavioral abnormalities and cognitiveimpairment. We will use a floxed-stop cassette and an inducible CRE transgene to achieve regulated activationof the transcriptionally inactive targeted Scn1a locus. We will generate the inactive allele Scn1aFS by insertingthe floxed-stop cassette into intron 1 of Scn1a using CRISPR-Cas9 targeting. The Scn1aFS allele will beactivated by tamoxifen-induced expression of an ER-CRE transgene. We will administer tamoxifen toheterozygous Scn1aFS/+ mice at 3 weeks or 6 weeks of age and assess the effects on seizure onset seizuresusceptibility and survival. These experiments will provide proof of principle regarding the effectiveness ofrestoring Scn1a activity for treatment of Dravet syndrome. We will also assess the time window for effectivetherapy. This work will provide a novel mouse model for future investigations of reversibility of behavioral andcognitive comorbidities and unique information regarding reversibility of the features of Dravet syndrome as aguide for future therapeutic interventions.,233375

Recent pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggests that cannabidiol (CBD) may provide an effective tolerable alternative to current therapeutics however its mechanism of action is unclear. In this study I will examine a newly described proposed target for cannabidiol and examine potential pathways by which CBD controls seizure activity at the synaptic systems and in vivo level.,NINDS,9413201,11/8/2017 0:00,PA-14-150,5F30NS100293-02,5,F30,NS,100293,2, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",12/12/2016 0:00,12/11/2020 0:00,NST-2 Study Section [NST-2], ,11443627,"ROSENBERG, EVAN CORY",Not Applicable,12,NEUROLOGY,121911077,M5SZJ6VHUHN8,121911077,M5SZJ6VHUHN8,US,40.669895,-73.974354,5998304,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10016,UNITED STATES,N,12/12/2017 0:00,12/11/2018 0:00,853,"Training, Individual",2018,44524, ,NINDS,44524, , ,This proposal focuses on examining the mechanism of cannabidiol (CBD) a non-psychoactive component of cannabis with documented anti-seizure effects in several pre-clinical studies(1 2) and a recent double-blinded multicenter phase III clinical trial in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy(3 4). Despite centuries of clinical usage the mechanism of action of CBD remains ambiguous. Further exploring the pharmacology of CBD may provide benefit to the 1/3 of epilepsy patients with seizures resistant to current treatments (10).  In one leading hypothesis CBD acts as a competitive antagonist at the G-protein coupled receptor GPR55 inhibiting binding of a membrane phospholipid lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). CBD blocks LPI- mediated increases in presynaptic Ca2+ and vesicular release thus reducing excitability at axon terminals (12). However the function of LPI-GPR55 signaling at inhibitory synapses as well as potential postsynaptic effects remains to be explored.  Using a multidisciplinary approach with ex vivo whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and in vitro immunocytochemistry and molecular biology I discovered that LPI had unique effects at excitatory and inhibitory synapses both at the pre- and postsynapse. At 5-10 minutes post application LPI increased the frequency of vesicular release in CA1 hippocampus consistent with previous reports of presynaptic locus of GPR55 action(12). However contrary to prior studies I identified prominent GPR55 staining in the cell bodies of CA1 pyramidal neurons and a postsynaptic LPI effect of increased GluA1 AMPAR expression at 50-60 minutes post application. I also determined that LPI reduced inhibitory postsynaptic strength in part by reducing GABAAR 2 subunit expression. Taken together these results suggest that LPI increases the excitatory / inhibitory ratio in hippocampal neuronal networks by a dual mechanism: enhancing excitatory transmission and attenuating inhibition. This predicts that CBD by opposing LPI action may exert its beneficial anti-seizure effects on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses through actions at GPR55. I plan to explore these possibilities by repeating these experiments with CBD pre-treatment and GPR55-/- mice as controls.  To supplement these experiments at the circuit level I plan to investigate how LPI and CBD regulate evoked transmission and short-term plasticity in CA3-CA1 hippocampal circuits. At the in vivo level I will use both acute and chronic seizure models to determine seizure susceptibility in GPR55-/- mice. Based on surprising preliminary results I discovered that seizure activity upregulates GPR55 membrane expression producing a biomarker for prolonged seizures and potentiating the effects of LPI. In all as part of this fellowship I propose to combine my clinical training and scientific experience to elucidate the mechanisms of this intriguing therapeutic target for epilepsy and help stratify subpopulations for targeted treatment.,44524

Despite the development of mouse models pathophysiological mechanisms for these disorders are poorly understood. One particularly devastating channelopathy is Dravet Syndrome (DS) a severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy typically caused by de novo dominant mutations in SCN1A encoding the voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) Nav1.1. Heterologous expression of mutant channels suggests haploinsufficiency raising the question of how loss of VGSCs underlying action potentials (APs) produces hyperexcitability. Data from DS mouse models indicate both decreased Na+ current in interneurons implicating disinhibition and increased Na+ current in pyramidal cells implicating hyperexcitability depending on genetic background brain area and animal age. To understand the effects of SCN1A DS mutations in human neurons we derived forebrain-like neurons from two DS subjects by induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming of patient fibroblasts and compared them with iPSC-derived neurons from human controls. We found that DS patient-derived neurons have increased Na+ current density in both bipolar- and pyramidal-shaped neurons. Consistent with increased Na+ current both putative excitatory and inhibitory patient-derived neurons showed spontaneous bursting and other evidence of hyperexcitability. Our data provided some of the first evidence that epilepsy patient-specific neurons obtained via the iPSC method are useful for modeling epileptic-like hyperactivity. Moreover our findings revealed a previously unrecognized potential epilepsy mechanism underlying DS and offered a platform for future screening of novel anti-epileptic therapies using patient-derived neurons. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular basis of genetic epilepsies. Our objective is to determine epilepsy mechanisms of SCN1A-linked DS in humans. We will test the central hypothesis that SCN1A haploinsufficiency leads to paradoxically increased Na+ current in excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as alterations in other ionic currents that underlie neuronal hyperexcitability in DS. The rationale fr this work is that identifying the role of SCN1A haploinsufficiency in the development of hyperexcitability may lead to novel treatments for DS as well as related pediatric epilepsies. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1: To determine whether SCN1A haploinsufficiency causes alterations in the expression of other VGSC -subunits that lead to increased Na+ current in DS patient-specific iPSC neurons. 2: To investigate changes in synaptic function in DS patient-specific iPSC neurons. 3: To determine the electrophysiological characteristics of DS patient-specific and control iPSC neurons differentiated in the rodent brain.This work is expected to reveal how SCN1A haploinsufficiency contributes to epilepsy in humans. Our results will have positive impact because this work will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of DS and related diseases and may lead to novel therapeutic agents for epilepsy.,630272

These include Dravet Syndrome (DS) and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Both DS and GEFS+ are autosomal dominant disorders but relatively little is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying seizure generation. Here we propose to assess the functional consequences of disease causing mutations on neuronal activity using two complementary genetic model systems: knock-in Drosophila with SCN1A mutations and iPSC-derived neurons from patients with the same mutations. Our preliminary data demonstrate that knock-in of a GEFS+ SCN1A mutation (K1270T) into the Drosophila sodium channel gene para causes a semi-dominant temperature-induced seizure phenotype. Electrophysiological studies of GABAergic interneurons in the brains of adult GEFS+ flies reveal a novel cellular mechanism underlying heat-induced seizure. Consistent with disease symptoms in humans the seizure phenotype caused by knock-in of a DS mutation (S1231R) is more severe than GEFS+. The congruence of the genotype-to-phenotype map between flies and human in this genetic disease model paves the way for use of knock-in Drosophila to study the mechanisms underlying these complex human genetic disorders. The first two aims are focused on use of Drosophila sodium channel knock-in lines to further explore the underlying cellular mechanisms contributing to heat-induced seizures and as a low cost high efficiency platform for discovery of genetic modifiers and drugs that suppress the seizure phenotype. In specific Aim 3 we will employ our expertise in stem cell biology to conduct parallel studies of neuronal activity in iPSC-derived neurons from patients with the same GEFS+ mutations examined in knock-in flies. Identification of common cellular mechanisms in these two model systems has the potential to identify targets for development of novel therapies to reduce or eliminate seizures in humans with epilepsy.,526152

Thus this research is relevant to the NIH's mission that pertains tosupporting the ongoing basic research foster research that has immediate medical relevance and encouragetranslational research that links the discoveries from basic research into therapeutic interventions for treatingneurological disorders such as epilepsy.,NINDS,9360727,4/11/2017 0:00,PA-16-160,1R01NS102181-01,1,R01,NS,102181,1, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",4/15/2017 0:00,2/28/2022 0:00,Therapeutic Approaches to Genetic Diseases Study Section[TAG], ,10571121,"BURRE, JACQUELINE ",Not Applicable,12,NEUROLOGY,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,60217502,YNT8TCJH8FQ8,US,40.7607,-73.9603,1514803,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,100654805,UNITED STATES,N,4/15/2017 0:00,2/28/2018 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2017,359249, ,NINDS,218750,140499, ,Mutations in Munc18-1 are associated with three infantile epileptic encephalopathies but the mechanistic relationship between mutations and these diseases is unknown. The long term goal is to clarify mechanisms bywhich specific synaptic dysfunctions trigger neurological disorders. The objective in this application is to determine how mutations in Munc18-1 cause neuronal defects and to identify rescue strategies to reverse suchdeficits. Munc18-1 (also called STXBP1 SEC1 in yeast Rop in flies and unc18 in worms) controls neurotransmitter release at the synapse via binding to multiple effector proteins. Over 30 heterozygous de novo mu-tations have been identified in the Munc18-1 gene that cause the infantile epileptic encephalopathies Ohtahara West and Dravet syndrome but it is unknown how these mutations affect neurons and trigger three different diseases. The central hypothesis based on strong preliminary data is that mutations in Munc18-1 result indefects in its folding stability and localization and elicit same defects in wild-type Munc18-1. This loss of functional Munc18-1 subsequently impairs the function of its effectors and triggers synaptic dysfunction which canbe restored by stabilizing Munc18-1. The rationale for these studies is that understanding of how mutations inMunc18-1 trigger synaptic dysfunction in infantile epileptic encephalopathies will create opportunities for thedevelopment of novel therapies beyond the current limited symptom-based therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data this hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of disease-relevantmutations in Munc18-1 on protein stability; 2) Determine how Munc18-1 mutants affect the stability of its effectors and synapse function; and 3) Identify rescue strategies to stabilize Munc18-1 and restore its function. Under the first aim stability folding aggregation and intracellular targeting will be quantified for Munc18-1 wild-type and mutants combining purified recombinant proteins and primary neurons with biochemical and cell biological techniques. Under the second aim stability interaction and targeting of Munc18-1's effectors syntaxin-1 Doc2 Mint1 Mint2 and rab3 as well as synapse integrity and function will be analyzed using purified proteins primary neurons and in vivo mouse and worm models. Under the third aim chemical and molecularchaperones will be employed to restore deficits in Munc18-1 and in synapse structure and function usingsame paradigms as for aims 1 and 2. This research is significant because it will clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying Munc18-1-linked epilepsies and will have translational importance in the development of newrational treatments. This research is innovative because it 1) tests the novel hypothesis that Munc18-1 mutations cause synaptic dysfunction via a dominant-negative mechanism 2) uses a multidisciplinary and systematic approach that has not previously been used in this research area 3) is technically innovative because ofnewly generated C. elegans strains and 4) shifts focus from a symptom-centered perspective to an approachthat focusses on understanding convergent underlying disease mechanisms that pivot on Munc18-1.,359249

The most common diagnoses that increase risk for SDY include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy coronary artery anomalies of wrong sinus origin arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ion channelopathies and genetic forms of epilepsy such as Dravet Syndrome.  In up to 30% of cases of SDY no specific diagnosis is found (autopsy negative).  Sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been documented at all ages and may be associated with competitive athletics.  Approximately 10-15% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases may be due to ion channelopathies.  Similarly sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been documented at all ages and several risk factors have been identified including some cases originating with ion channelopathies.  Noncompliance of antiepileptic medication usage and polytherapy in patients with refractory epilepsy are also risk factors for SUDEP. The Sudden Death in the Young (SDY) Initiative is a two-phase program to explore and provide greater understanding of SDY.  The second phase of the program will support scientific research through the use of the registry data and DNA samples using the NIH grant mechanism.  The second phase of the program will run concurrently with the SDY Registry.,12424

This is due largely to the lack of good modelsystems and tools to rapidly study relevant electrical and synaptic phenotypes. We aim toovercome these challenges. Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)technology reveal the first prospects for studying human neurons paired with clinical historiesusing fast in vitro technologies. The complex electrophysiological behavior of these cell can berecorded with the Optopatch platform and microscope systems recently developed at Q-State.With these tools it is possible to simultaneously stimulate (blue light) and record (red light)electrical activity from around a hundred neurons with one millisecond temporal resolutionsingle cell spatial resolution and high signal to noise. This system can be used to measuresingle cell excitability and firing patters or to probe synaptic transmission by stimulating a subsetof neurons with spatially patterned blue light. Moving forward we propose to increasemicroscope throughput without sacrificing capabilities and rigorously test the platformsperformance. First the microscope will be upgraded with advanced environmental controls 96-well plate compatibility and a fluid-handling robot for compound addition. Next data storageand analysis will be securely moved to the cloud to handle 2.5 Terabyte/day data rates. Oncethe microscope is fully functional sensitivity and reproducibility (well to well plate to plate andbatch to batch) will be tested using a library of control compounds. Finally as a first applicationwe will search for a robust screenable phenotype for Dravet syndrome. Neurons will beprepared from ten healthy and ten Dravet patients to look for differences in firing that transcendvariation in the genetic background. A drug that ameliorates the disease phenotype in themajority of cell lines is a promising candidate to be broadly effective in the clinic. A wellvalidated high-throughput electrophysiology platform with confirmed phenotypic readouts inhuman iPSC disease neurons has the potential to change the drug screening landscape forneurological disorders. We hope to open a new path to finding treatments for these horriblediseases.,318023

Until now there has not been an organized clinical network specifically focused on individuals at high risk for SUDEP. Moreover there is a lack of unified clinical monitoring algorithms that will stratify SUDEP risk i patient population allow in-depth correlative analysis with brain morphometric studies and genetic investigations and inform model systems of premature epilepsy mortality. We therefore propose a Clinical Network Core (SRA-CNC) that consists of four principal components: (1) a Pediatric Clinical Network (PCN) aimed at recruitment physiological monitoring and sample collection in children affected by Dravet syndrome (2) an Adult Clinical Network (ACN) focused on high SUDEP risk adult patients based on the combined phenotype of epilepsy cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory dysfunction (3) Analysis Center entails physiological morphometric and epidemiological evaluations of the human data and (4) Data integration and storage. The SRA-CNC will perform four main functions; (1) It will establish infrastructure logistical and regulatory support and implement standard operating procedures for case ascertainment scope and mode of physiological monitoring and data collection and procurement of biological specimens; (2) it will provide problem focused expert analysis of the (i) clinical and epidemiological data (ii) ictal cardiac and respiratory physiology and (iii) imaging based morphometry; (3) It will optimize resource utilization and facilitate data exchange analysis and communication among participating centers; and (4) SRA-CNC will translate investigational procedures into clinical practice in the form of public education and evidence driven recommendations. The Clinical Network Core is an essential component of the proposed SUDEP Center Without Wall piloted by the investigators of SUDEP Research Alliance as it will inform and facilitate current and future research translational projects in humans and i the individualized model systems.,160889

Idiopathic generalized epilepsy(IGE) has been recognized asits genetic origins which include many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or mutation ofionotropic receptors such as GABAergic receptor (GABAR) subunit mutations (Gabrg2Q390X andGabra1A322D) linked to severe Dravet epilepsy syndrome and child absence epilepsy andcognitive comorbidity in patients. In contrast to acquired seizures study IGE seizure andepileptogenesis mechanism remains largely elusive. Moreover seizures and sleepinfluence/interact with each other in their physiology mechanism which imposes a challenge toIGE study and patient treatment. In one recent human patient study sleep-like slow-waveoscillation has been shown to facilitate epileptic seizure activity. Therefore we hypothesize thatsleep-related slow-wave hyperpolarization-depolarization oscillation(SWO) can drivehomeostatic potentiation(HSP) of excitatory synaptic currents not inhibitory synaptic currents incortical neurons of thalamocortical circuitry in IGE animal models with Gabrg2Q390X orGabra1A322D mutation and therefore create an escaped excitatory synaptic currents (withoutbalancing from inhibitory synaptic currents) in cortical neurons during sleep and sleep-waketransition. This critical step of gabaergic current HSP impairment induced by SWOs can lead toseizure occurrence/initiation and also contribute to epileptogenesis in IGE models. This work willfill a critical void in our understanding of seizure mechanism plus epileptogenesis andpotentially generate a new seizure therapy. First we will study whether SWO-induced HSP ofinhibitory GABAR-mediated currents is impaired but not excitatory AMPAR-mediated currentsin layer V-VI cortical neurons in vitro from heterozygous Gabrg2+/Q390X or Gabra1+/A322D knock-inmice and whether this impairment results in neuronal elevated firing. Second we will determinewhether light-induced SWOs in vivo causally initiate epileptic activity in cortex from miceexpressing halorhodopsin (NpHR) and Gabrg2Q390X or Gabra1A322D mutation. Last we will use aretinoid acid synthesis blocker DEAB to maintain the dynamic HSP balance between synapticexcitatory and inhibitory currents during SWOs in IGE models which will provide a proof ofprinciple for a potential seizure therapy. The information generated in these studies willsubstantially alter our view of seizure/epileptogenesis regarding its interaction with sleep wavesand eventually lead to a new seizure therapy in IGE patients.,197500

We recently found thatin vivo ABHD6 inhibition decreases seizure incidence in several mouse models of epilepsy and that thistherapeutic response does not undergo tolerance nor does it produce overt side effects. These resultssuggest that ABHD6 inhibition might represent a novel anti-epileptic therapeutic approach. In this R21 grant proposal we will test the therapeutic efficacy of a novel inhibitor of ABHD6 KT-182 inScn1a+/- mice a preclinical mouse model of Dravet Syndrome that accurately mimics this devastatingintractable epilepsy that begins in infancy. Our hypothesis is that ABHD6 inhibition will significantly reduceseizure severity in Scn1a+/- mice without producing overt side effect and tolerance. To test this hypothesis wewill address three aims: 1. Effect of ABHD6 inhibition on thermally-induced seizures 2. Effect of ABHD6 inhibition on spontaneous seizures and premature death 3. Effect of ABHD6 inhibition on EEG and neuronal excitabilityThe results gathered through this R21 grant will provide a solid foundation for future research aimed atdeveloping ABHD6 inhibitors as new therapeutics for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome. This research willalso increase our basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which endogenous 2-AG signallingcontrols synaptic transmission and seizure incidence.,232313

We found that a neuron-enriched microRNA miR-128 acts as a negative master modulator of neuronal signaling responses in mice. The importance of the miR-128 in brain function is underscored by the development of fatal epileptic seizures in mice that lack miR-128 in postnatal forebrain neurons. Accordingly overexpression of miR-128 in neurons attenuates chemically-induced seizures and rescues survival in mice. These findings reveal miR-128 as a previously unknown key regulator of neuronal activity with a potential for the development of novel anti-epileptic therapeutic approaches. The major regulatory function of miR-128 highlights the importance of the mechanisms that control miR-128 expression levels as well as miR-128 access to its targets in neurons. We found that calcineurin/NFAT activity an important signaling pathway in neuronal development and function controls miR-128 expression in neurons. Most importantly mice with neuronal calcineurin deficiency develop a fatal seizure syndrome similar to the one observed in mice with miR-128 deficiency. These findings provided a strong indication for the role of calcineurin/NFAT signaling in control of miR-128 expression. The mechanism of calcineurin/NFAT-mediated regulation of miR-128 expression will be addressed in this proposal. The proposal also addresses a novel mechanism of regulation of miR-128 effector function. Preliminary data suggest that access of miR-128 to its mRNA targets is regulated by miR-128-sequestring non-coding decoy RNAs. This novel mechanism of regulation of miR-128 effector function will be explored in experiments using unique mouse models with inactivation or overexpression of the neuron-specific miR-128 decoy RNAs in combination with the molecular electrophysiological and behavioral approaches that have been established in our laboratory. The central role of miR-128 in neuronal signaling makes this miRNA an attractive target for potential therapeutic intervention of epilepsy. Using a mouse model of the human Dravet syndrome one the most severe and often treatment resistant forms of epilepsy the proposal will explore the therapeutic potential of neuronal miR-128 modulation for the treatment of the disease. To bring the research closer to the development of actual antiepileptic therapy we will explore the antiepileptic potential of exogenously expressed miR-128. MiR-128 will be delivered to defined neurons using neurotrophic adeno-associated viruses (AAV) that are currently considered as the most reliable vehicle for in vivo gene delivery in mice and human. In summary our proposal describes highly innovative and hypothesis driven studies of a novel non-coding RNA mechanism for controlling neuronal signaling and activity that has a strong potential to be applied for the treatment of human epilepsy.,65135

We have developed a mouse genetic model with all the features of DS including susceptibility to thermally induced seizures and spontaneous seizures ataxia circadian rhythm and sleep disorders cognitive deficit autistic-like features and premature death. All these effects are correlated with loss of Na currents and excitability of GABAergic interneurons without effects on excitatory neurons which causes imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neural circuits. Mutation of Nav1.1 channels specifically in forebrainGABAergic interneurons by the Cre-Lox method is sufficient to cause the major DS symptoms confirming that DS is caused by loss of Nav1.1 channels in inhibitory neurons. Remarkably cognitive deficit and autistic-like behaviors of DS mice can be rescued by treatment with a low dose of the GABA-A receptor co-activator clonazepam demonstrating that these life- changing co-morbidities are caused by the mutation of Nav1.1 channels rather than by neuronal damage from recurrent seizures. Our central hypothesis is that epilepsy and co-morbidities in DS result from failure of excitability of GABAergic inhibitory neurons which creates an imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neural circuits and that re-balancing excitation and inhibition with rug treatment will have therapeutic value. To further advance understanding of pathophysiology and treatment of DS we propose four experimental approaches. (i) We will examine hyperexcitability of cells and circuits using specific deletion of Nav1.1 channels in different classes of interneurons in specific brain regions by the Cre-Lox method. We will use brain slice recording methods to document changes in excitability of cells and circuits. (ii) We will use immunocytochemical and mouse genetic approaches to identify the sites of hyperexcitability that appear first in DS mice in vivo and thereby determine the time course of changes in excitability of cells and circuits that lead to epilepsy. (iii) Patients with DS have prolonged episodes of status epilepticus. We will induce status epilepticus in DS mice by thermal stimulation and determine the changes in excitability of cells and circuits. We will assess cell injury by measurements of reactive astrocytes neuroinflammation apoptosis and neuronal cell death. (iv) Our results indicate that rationally designed drug combinations that increase GABAergic neurotransmission are effective in reducing seizures and premature death in DS mice with minimal side effects and that a single low-dose clonazepam treatment can rescue cognitive deficit and autistic-like behaviors. We will optimize combination therapy with a benzodiazepine plus tiagabine in order to develop a therapeutic regimen that prevents seizures premature death and cognitive impairment and minimizes effects of tolerance on prolonged therapy. We will examine new-generation subtype-selective GABA-A receptor activators and test effectiveness of these therapies approaches to control seizures and co-morbidities in DS mice.,337969

The neural bases for sleep disorders in DS are unknown in part because until recently there were no animal models for this disease. The main goal of this grant is to study the mechanisms underlying these sleep disorders using a recently developed mouse model of DS.,NINDS,9317556,7/21/2017 0:00,PA-13-302,5R01NS094211-03,5,R01,NS,94211,3, ,"HE, JANET",9/1/2015 0:00,8/31/2019 0:00,"Neuroendocrinology, Neuroimmunology, Rhythms and Sleep Study Section[NNRS]", ,8146532,"DE LA IGLESIA, HORACIO O",Not Applicable,7,BIOLOGY,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2017 0:00,8/31/2018 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2017,337969, ,NINDS,218750,119219, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Animals carrying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the Scn1a gene (Scn1a+/- mice) which encodes a subunit of the voltage-gated Na+ channel NaV1.1 show deficits in both homeostatic regulation of sleep and circadian regulation of rest-activity cycles. The NaV1.1 channel is the primary voltage-gated Na+ channel in adult GABAergic interneurons and its reduced activity results in a decrease of GABAergic tone suggesting that sleep regulatory deficits in Scn1a+/- mice emerge from reduced GABAergic activity. However Scn1a+/- mice are a model of a severe form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome (DS) and as DS patients show not only dysregulation of sleep but also generalized seizures. Epileptic activity complicates the interpretation of sleep disorders in DS as sleep regulatory deficits could be the result of sleep disruption by seizures or of seizure-associated neural damage. Our hypothesis is that sleep disorders in DS are the consequence of reduced GABAergic tone within sleep regulatory centers that is independent of the presence of seizures. To address this hypothesis we propose to conditionally target the Scn1a+/- mutation to specific neurons and brain regions. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether sleep abnormalities in global Scn1a+/- mice emerge from the effect of the mutation specifically on GABAergic neurons. We will target the Scn1a+/- mutation to these cells using an Scn1alox/- mouse and a Cre driver mouse line that targets GABAergic neurons throughout the brain and will assess the integrity of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep in these mutants. This approach will unequivocally determine whether sleep regulatory deficits in Scn1a+/- mice are the result of reduced NaV1.1 channel activity within GABAergic cells or whether non- GABAergic cells that express the channel also contribute to this phenotype. Specific Aim 2 will target the Scn1a+/- mutation to cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) the site of the central circadian pacemaker that regulates sleep. Viruses expressing Cre recombinase targeting either all SCN cells or specifically vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-containing cells will be injected wihin the SCN of Scn1alox/+ mice. We will also target the mutation to the SCN VIPergic cells by crossing Scn1alox/+ mice with a mouse line in which the VIP promoter drives the expression of Cre. Because VIP neurons are essential for the integrity of the SCN oscillatory network we expect that these VIP-specific Scn1a+/- mutants will show similar effects to mutants in which all SCN cells are targeted. Specific Aim 3 will virally target the Scn1a+/- mutation to the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RNT) which is essential for the generation of slow-wave sleep and spindles during non- REM sleep both compromised in Scn1a+/- mice. None of the conditional mutant approaches in Aims 1 and 2 is expected to induce seizures offering a unique opportunity to assess the effect of reduced NaV1.1 channel activity in sleep regulatory regions in the absence of seizures. We predict that the conditional targeting of the Scn1a+/- mutation to the SCN and RNT will lead to deficits in circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep respectively. These results would provide direct support for the role of the NaV1.1 channel within these brain regions in the regulation of sleep. They would also directly support our hypothesis that both circadian and homeostatic sleep deficits in DS emerge from seizure-independent reduced GABAergic activity in specific brain regions providing new avenues for the treatment of sleep disorders in DS.,337969

There is a surprisingly common lack of awareness among patients and physicians of this increased risk of sudden death. In a recent survey only 56% of Canadian pediatricians who treat patients with epilepsy knew their patients were at increased risk for sudden death and only 33% of these physicians knew the term SUDEP. There is controversy regarding whether cardiac failure or respiratory arrest is more important as the primary cause of death but cardiac and respiratory data is rarely collected simultaneously from human cases of SUDEP or from mouse models. For example in the more than 20 documented cases of SUDEP that occurred while the patient was undergoing EMU monitoring none of these patients had measurements of ventilation or even blood oxygenation. Effective preventive strategies in high-risk epileptic patients will rely on defining the mechanisms that lead from seizures to death. Our preliminary data suggest that respiratory depression is the primary cause of death in some cases of SUDEP and that patients with Dravet syndrome have previously uncharacterized breathing abnormalities in the peri-ictal period. Furthermore our data has indicated there is an anatomical pathway that inhibits ventilation which extends from the amygdala and anterior temporal lobe to medullary nuclei that control breathing. However it is unclear how this circuit is connected and the identities of the neurons involved. In Aim 1 we will characterize peri-ictal cardiorespiratory control in human patients with Dravet syndrome as well as mouse models of this pathology. In Aim 2 we will define the anatomical pathway from the amygdala to the brainstem that inhibits the cardiovascular and respiratory control networks during seizures. Finally in Aim 3 we will determine the identity of brainstem neurons that receive inputs from the amygdala and inhibit breathing and consciousness during seizures. This work will identify an anatomical pathway by which cortical seizures can invade the midbrain and brainstem and cause depressed cardiorespiratory function and arousal. Our findings have the potential to characterize key components of this circuit and may identify biomarkers that can be used to develop effective screening strategies. Better understanding mechanisms that underlie SUDEP will allow future development of preventative treatments that may decrease SUDEP risk.,642537

Although SUDEP is the most devastating consequence of epilepsy and the leading cause of epilepsy mortality astonishingly little is understood about its causes and no biomarkers exist to identify at risk epilepsy patients. To advance our understanding of these critical issues we will focus on Dravet Syndrome (DS) a severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy associated with a high SUDEP incidence. DS is most frequently caused by mutations in the voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) gene SCN1A encoding NaV1.1. As NaV1.1 is expressed in brain heart and peripheral nerves a compelling idea is that altered Na+ currents (INa) in DS cardiac myocytes (CMs) or autonomic neurons in addition to central neurons lead to arrhythmias and SUDEP. We used the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) method to derive central and peripheral neurons and CMs from fibroblasts of DS subjects. Preliminary data from DS patient CMs suggest that a subset of DS subjects shows abnormal CM INa and excitability. In studies of a DS human mutant SCN1A knock-in mouse model we observed spontaneous seizures and SUDEP increased ventricular CM INa density and ventricular arrhythmias at the time of SUDEP. Similarly we found increased ventricular CM INa density spontaneous seizures and SUDEP in a Scn1b null DS mouse model. Our work studies of Scn1a heterozygous null DS mice and clinical ECG studies in DS also show altered cardiac autonomic function. Thus we hypothesize that SUDEP in DS is caused by VGSC mutations that produce cardiac electrical and/or autonomic dysfunction in addition to brain dysfunction. Furthermore that combined insights from studies of DS patient-derived cells mouse models and patient peri-ictal ECG data will yield biomarkers of SUDEP risk in DS.  Four specific aims will test these hypotheses: 1) To understand the effects of DS-linked SCN1A mutations on cardiac excitability using DS patient iPSC-derived CMs and DS mice; 2) To determine how DS-linked SCN1A mutations influence the excitability of autonomic neurons cardiac autonomic innervation and autonomic control of cardiac function using DS patient iPSC-derived autonomic neurons and DS mice; 3) To investigate changes in autonomic excitability in a second mouse model of DS Scn1b null mice and in SCN1B-DS patient iPSC CMs and neurons; and 4) To determine whether cardiac electrical and/or autonomic function is altered in DS patients at baseline or peri-ictally. Our wor will synergize with the entire CWOW proposal to not only uncover SUDEP mechanisms in DS but also to provide advances in understanding SUDEP causes and biomarkers that will be applicable to other refractory epilepsies due to ion channelopathies and perhaps other etiologies. This work will also show proof-of-principle for the use of multiple platforms (cellularand clinical data from the same patients and multiple mouse models) to individualize SUDEP risk and develop patient-specific preventative treatments.",666500

The disorder results from haploinsufficiency of SCN1A a neuronal voltage-gatedsodium channel gene. The encoded channel Nav1.1 is an abundant sodium channel in the mammaliannervous system. We propose to investigate the reversibility of prenatal and early postnatal effects of Scn1ahaploinsufficiency using a mouse model that recapitulates seizures behavioral abnormalities and cognitiveimpairment. We will use a floxed-stop cassette and an inducible CRE transgene to achieve regulated activationof the transcriptionally inactive targeted Scn1a locus. We will generate the inactive allele Scn1aFS by insertingthe floxed-stop cassette into intron 1 of Scn1a using CRISPR-Cas9 targeting. The Scn1aFS allele will beactivated by tamoxifen-induced expression of an ER-CRE transgene. We will administer tamoxifen toheterozygous Scn1aFS/+ mice at 3 weeks or 6 weeks of age and assess the effects on seizure onset seizuresusceptibility and survival. These experiments will provide proof of principle regarding the effectiveness ofrestoring Scn1a activity for treatment of Dravet syndrome. We will also assess the time window for effectivetherapy. This work will provide a novel mouse model for future investigations of reversibility of behavioral andcognitive comorbidities and unique information regarding reversibility of the features of Dravet syndrome as aguide for future therapeutic interventions.,193750

Most concerning are the severe seizures and high risk of suddenunexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Mutations in voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC)  and  subunitgenes are linked to DS. While the majority of DS cases are linked to SCN1A haploinsufficiency SCN1Bhomozygous mutations are also linked to DS. Scn1b-/- mice have a DS phenotype with SUDEP. SCN1Bencodes VGSC 1 subunits which are developmentally regulated cell adhesion molecules and ion channelmodulators that play critical roles in the regulation of excitability. Scn1b-/- mice have cell type specific changesin Na+ (INa) and K+ (IK) currents. In addition Scn1b-/- mice have neuronal proliferation migration andpathfinding defects at postnatal day (P)5 that precede seizure onset at ~P10. These data suggested thatalterations in CAM function may contribute to hyperexcitability however new data challenge this idea and offerthe alternative explanation that defective cell adhesion in SCN1B-linked DS may not contribute to seizures butinstead impact other co-morbidities. Preliminary data show that Scn1b-/- mice also have delayed maturation ofneuronal Cl- gradients such that GABAergic signaling remains depolarizing and excitatory until ~P17-18 whichmay contribute to hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The objective of this work is to understand themechanism of hyperexcitability in SCN1B-linked DS. The central hypothesis is that the mechanism ofhyperexcitability in the Scn1b-/- model of DS is cell type specific changes in INa IK and GABAergic signaling.Further it is proposed that human SCN1B-DS mutations result in loss-of-function with similar defects in ioniccurrents and delayed maturation of GABAergic signaling as observed in Scn1b-/- neurons. The experimentalplan will test three Aims: 1. To determine the mechanism of hyperexcitability resulting from Scn1b deletion; 2.To determine whether human SCN1B-linked DS mutations result in loss-of-function in mouse models; 3. Todetermine the phenotype of SCN1B-linked DS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons.Model choice is key to understanding epilepsy mechanisms. Importantly mice are not small humans. Thuspatient-derived iPSC neuronal models provide essential information regarding human disease. On the otherhand mature brain networks cannot yet be replicated using iPSCs and so brain slice preparations fromtransgenic mouse models remain important to understanding circuitry. Rather than relying on a single modelthis project will compare and contrast human and mouse models to understand key mechanistic aspects of thedevelopment of hyperexcitability in DS. Even though SCN1B-linked DS is rare compared to SCN1A-linkeddisease this work may lead to the discovery of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in DS caused bymultiple types of gene mutations.,702340

The patients suffering from DS have intractable seizures and mental impairment and with poor outcome. In this proposal we will use a mouse model which harbors a mutation causing DS in humans and manifests the symptoms seen in humans with DS to study the detailed underlying mechanisms of DS and to develop a novel therapeutic strategy against this disorder.,NINDS,9304342,6/13/2017 0:00,PA-11-260,5R01NS082635-05,5,R01,NS,82635,5, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",7/1/2013 0:00,6/30/2019 0:00,Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section[CNNT], ,8897491,"KANG, JING-QIONG ",Not Applicable,7,Unavailable,79917897,GYLUH9UXHDX5,79917897,GYLUH9UXHDX5,US,36.143784,-86.800995,10040927,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,NASHVILLE,TN,Independent Hospitals,372320011,UNITED STATES,N,7/1/2017 0:00,6/30/2019 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2017,345625, ,NINDS,218750,126875, ,DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): GABAA receptor subunit gene mutations are frequently associated with epilepsy. Most such epilepsy syndromes are rather benign and are outgrown as patient age. However truncation mutations in the GABAA receptor gamma2 subunit gene GABRgamma2 are often but not always associated with a more severe phenotype Dravet syndrome (DS). To date most DS patients are associated with SCN1A loss of function mutations that result in impaired GABAergic interneuron activity and action potential firing. Synaptic GABAA receptors mediate inhibitory GABAergic transmission and characterizations of DS mouse model harboring GABRgamma2 (Q351X) mutation would provide new insights into the pathogenesis of DS as well as epilepsy in general. Combination of understandings from both SCN1A and GABRgamma2 mouse models will help pinpoint the final common pathophysiologic pathway on which two distinct groups of mutations converge. GABRgamma2 (Q351X) mutation is associated with two DS pedigrees. The heterozygous GABRgamma2 (Q351X) knockin (KI) mice which are patient condition recapitulate the major features of DS. The mice displayed multiple neurodevelopmental abnormalities and multiple forms of epilepsy including generalized tonic clonic epilepsy suggesting impaired synapse formation and function. Since simple GABRgamma2 gene knockout (KO) heterozygous mice do not have seizures this suggests that presence of the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunit protein and its related pathology contribute to the severe DS phenotype. We have previously demonstrated that the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunits were loss of function. Additionally the mutant protein accumulated intracellularly formed aggregates and imposed a dominant-negative effect on the wildtype subunits. The mutant aggregates were identified by mass spectrometry and the components of the aggregates were similar to those identified in inclusions found in neurodegenerative diseases such as the Lewy bodies characteristic of Parkinson's disease. Our pilot data demonstrated that the mutant protein also formed substantial aggregates in the heterozygous KI mice. The mutant subunits impaired GABAergic synaptogenesis and GABAergic transmission. The single quantum dot imaging indicated the synapse vs. extrasynapse distribution of GABAA receptors were altered in the mutant KI mice. We hypothesize that the accumulation and aggregation of the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunits impair synapse development and GABAergic transmission thus resulting in the severe phenotype as DS. In this proposal we will characterize in detail the mutant subunit accumulation aggregation and its impact on synapse formation stabilization connectivity and transmission. We will also characterize adaptive changes of wildtype GABAA receptor expression distribution mobility and turnover as well as neurobehaviors in the mutant GABRG2 (Q351X) heterozygous KI mice. We found overexpression of heat shock protein (Hsp)70 and Hsp40 reduced the total mutant and aggregated gamma2 subunit protein. We thus propose to test a novel therapeutic strategy by upregulating chaperones like Hsp70 and Hsp40 in the mutant KI mice.,345625

Clinical observations andanimal studies suggest that seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) is the primary event leading to SUDEP.Although current studies implicate serotonin (5-HT) (also adenosine) in S-IRA it is unclear if otherneurotransmitters contribute to S-IRA and how these neurotransmitters modulate S-IRA. These gaps inknowledge have significantly hindered the development of effective prevention strategies against SUDEP.Monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain such as 5-HT norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) arearousal-promoting and may stimulate breathing. In our preliminary and published studies in the DBA/1 mousemodel we determined that pharmacologic elevation of 5-HT or NE levels and optogenetic stimulation of 5-HT-mediated arousal suppress S-IRA. Thus in this high risk and high impact proposal we hypothesize thatenhanced monoamine-mediated arousal prevents seizure-induced sudden death in mice. We will testthis hypothesis in two separate SUDEP mouse models the DBA/1 mouse and the Dravet mouse that exhibitsthe salient features of Dravet syndrome (a type of epilepsy) in humans including spontaneous seizures. Inspecific aim 1 we will determine if pharmacologic enhancement of monoamine function reduces S-IRA and/orsudden death in both DBA/1 and Dravet mice. We will examine if 5-HT NE and DA are implicated in seizure-related mortality using monoamine reuptake inhibitors and identify the specific serotonergic adrenergic anddopaminergic receptors that are involved in prevention of seizure-related mortality. In specific aim 2 we willdetermine if selective stimulation of the dorsal raphe locus coeruleus or ventral tegmental area reduces S-IRAin both DBA/1 and Dravet mice. We will use optogenetics to activate the monoaminergic brain nuclei that areknown to mediate arousal response and examine if enhancing arousal mediated by each monoaminesuppresses S-IRA. If successful the proposed studies could lead to significant conceptual advance in themechanisms of SUDEP and foster development of novel pharmacologic and neurostimulatory strategiesagainst SUDEP. Completion of the proposed studies will establish animal models and methodology for furtherdissecting the neuronal circuitry investigating the interaction and elucidating the cellular mechanisms ofmonoamines involved in seizure-related mortality.,219107

Equally devastating intellectual and behavioraldisabilities severely disrupt quality of life for patients and caregivers and have no effective therapy. Classicallyintellectual impairments have been considered a direct effect of uncontrolled seizures and research has beentargeted at improving seizure control. Recent work in systems neurophysiology suggests that specific patternsof brain activity so-called brain rhythms underlie cognition and that disruption of these rhythms impairsintellectual ability. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether loss-of-function mutations inScn1a are sufficient to disrupt SWR and whether spatial memory is impaired in parallel. To determine whetherseizures contribute to spatial memory impairment to determine whether restoration of Scn1a expression withgene therapy recovers normal SWR features and improves spatial memory we will use existing DS mousemodels and generate a novel DS model in which Scn1a expression can be recovered in a previously affectedmouse a genetic `cure'.

Current drug therapies are ineffective at controlling seizures and no therapy exists forsevere cognitive deficits. While seizure frequency and severity often improves children with DS who surviveinto their teenage years have IQs in the severely impaired range 50 to 70 and typically require permanentinstitutional or family care. Therapy for cognitive impairment would dramatically improve the lives of thesepatients substantially reduce long-term care costs and reduce accidental deaths. Work in genetic mousemodels which are faithful genocopies and phenocopies shows that inhibitory interneuron but not excitatorycell activity is impaired resulting in an in-balance between excitation and inhibition the likely cause of seizuresand co-morbidities. An emerging principle from systems-level neuroscience is that cognition depends onprecisely timed electrophysiologic patterns brain rhythms. Whether disrupted brain rhythms contribute tocognitive impairment in human disease and whether interventions targeted at normalization of rhythmsthrough pharmaceuticals targeted stimulation or via correction of genetic defect are a reasonable therapeuticstrategy remains to be determined. Hippocampal sharp - wave / ripple (SWR) complexes contribute to spatiallearning and memory and require high frequency temporally precise action potential firing in inhibitoryinterneurons. We hypothesize that: Decreased SWR recurrence and slowed intra-ripple frequency arecaused by hippocampal interneuron hypoexcitability and contribute to spatial memory impairment inDS mice. The proposed experiments will: (1) extend the preliminary finding of decreased ripple recurrence andslowed intra-ripple frequency in DS mice comparing SWR features by sleep-wake state and during context-dependent spatial learning to determine if rate of SWR occurrence and intra-ripple frequency are correlatedwith Scn1a expression and memory performance (2) determine whether spatial memory impairment ismediated through effects of reduced Scn1a expression reduced Na current and hypoexcitability of forebrainGABAergic interneurons (3) determine whether seizures contribute to spatial memory impairment and alteredSWR features and (4) determine whether altered SWR features and impaired spatial memory can benormalized with restoration of Na channel expression. This work will be organized around the following specificaims: Aim 1: Dependence of SWR recurrence intra-ripple frequency and spatial memory impairmenton Scn1a expression Aim 2: Contribution of seizures to reduced SWR occurrence slowed intra-ripplefrequency and spatial memory impairment,337969

Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have treatment resistant (refractory) seizures thereby presenting a major clinical challenge and burden. The most common form of refractory epilepsy is mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) characterized by spontaneous seizures neuropsychological deficits and hippocampal sclerosis. At present surgical resection of the epilepsy focus is the best treatment strategy for this disorder; however this procedure is only used in a subset of cases. Consequently there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatments.  Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) SCN1A SCN2A and SCN3A are associated with several epilepsy subtypes including Dravet syndrome (DS) and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Gain of function mutations in the VGSC SCN8A have recently identified in individuals with epileptic encephalopathies. However our laboratory has demonstrated that mice with Scn8a mutations that reduce channel activity or expression are more resistant to induced seizures when compared to their wild-type littermates. In addition we were able to dramatically ameliorate seizure severity and restore normal lifespans to Scn1a mutants that model DS and GEFS+ by either co-segregation of an Scn8a mutation or hippocampal knockdown of Scn8a expression. Since the hippocampus is the major site of seizure generation and morphological changes in MTLE we hypothesize that selective reduction of SCN8A expression in the hippocampus will provide an effective strategy for the treatment of MTLE. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will establish the effect on spontaneous seizure frequency and severity of reducing hippocampal Scn8a expression in the widely used intra-hippocampal kainic acid mouse model of MTLE. Reduced Scn8a expression will be achieved by hippocampal injection of an adeno-associated viral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA against Scn8a (AAV-3). Seizure activity will be monitored in AAV-3 treated mice using continuous video/EEG analysis and will be compared to control mice injected with a scrambled construct (AAV-GFP). In Aim 2 we will determine if hippocampal reduction of Scn8a expression could also prevent or ameliorate the changes in behavior and hippocampal morphology and that are observed in this model of MTLE. Finally in Aim 3 we compare the biophysical properties of hippocampal slices from the AAV-3 and AAV-GFP treated mice in order to directly examine neuronal excitability. We will also test if partial pharmacological block of Nav1.6 using novel compounds can reduce seizure-like bursting activity in hippocampal slices from the MTLE mouse model and we will explore the contribution of the different VGSCs to the development of MTLE. This clinically relevant proposal will provide important insight into the feasibility of targeting SCN8A as a treatment for MTLE and more broadly for other forms of refractory epilepsy.,466344

Over 800 mutations in SCN1A encoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 have been reported patients. SCN1A mutations are associated with epilepsy phenotypes on the genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) spectrum. The GEFS+ spectrum ranges from simple febrile seizures on the mild end of the spectrum to Dravet syndrome on the severe end. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A result in Dravet syndrome an infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by a variety of seizure types developmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variable expressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by genetic modifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) model a number of features of Dravet syndrome including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reduced sodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons which is predicted to increase excitability due to failure of inhibition. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is stronglydependent on strain background. Scn1a+/- mice on the resistant 129 strain background (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrast Scn1a+/- mice on a (129xB6)F1 strain background (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality with 50% dying by 1 month of age. Based on the strain- dependent difference in phenotype we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severity. We recently mapped several modifier loci that influence premature lethality of Scn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal we will perform fine mapping and candidate gene analysis with the goal of identifying the responsible modifier genes. In addition to the strain-dependent differences in clinical severity we also observed strain-dependent differences in hippocampal neuron sodium currents (INa). GABAergic interneurons isolated from the F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased INa density compared to wildtype littermate controls. In contrast INa density is preserved in GABAergic interneurons isolated from 129.Scn1a+/- and is no different from wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for the loss of Nav1.1 while F1 interneurons do not. Based on this observation we hypothesize that there are strain differences in compensatory capacity in the context of Scn1a heterozygous deletion. We propose to perform RNA-seq analysis to characterize hippocampal transcriptome differences during the critical phase of phenotype onset in susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant 129.Scn1a+/- mice. The results of this analysis will suggest candidate modifier genes and pathways that influence phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Identification of Dravet syndrome modifier genes will provide insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and will suggest novel therapeutic strategies for the improved treatment of human patients.,337969

SCN1A mutations also lead to genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) aninherited disorder characterized by early-life FSs and the development of a wide range of adult epilepsysubtypes. Current anti-epilepsy drugs often fail to provide adequate protection against the severe seizures andneuropsychiatric comorbidities that occur in patients with SCN1A mutations. Furthermore almost a third of allepilepsy patients do not achieve adequate seizure control highlighting the urgent need to develop multimodaltreatments that can effectively mitigate the broad spectrum of clinical features associated with refractoryepilepsies while minimizing unwanted side effects. In this exploratory R21 proposal we will test the hypothesisthat Huperzine A (Hup A) a naturally occurring sesquiterpene Lycopodium alkaloid will be efficacious in thetreatment of DS. This hypothesis is based on the biological properties of Hup A its demonstrated clinicalsafety tolerability ability to improve cognitive function and our preliminary data. We will use heterozygousScn1a knockout mice (a model of DS) to evaluate the potential of Hup A to increase seizure thresholds andprevent spontaneous seizure generation (Aim 1) and to ameliorate cognitive and behavioral deficits (Aim 2).This clinically relevant proposal could lay the foundation for the development of a novel therapy to treatSCN1A-derived epilepsies. Furthermore since SCN1A mutations lead to reduced neuronal inhibition which isa shared mechanism underlying many common forms of epilepsy the outcome of this study may haveimportant broad implications for the treatment of refractory epilepsies.,193486

Childhood epileptic encephalopathies are the most severe form of epilepsy with onset in early childhood multiple seizure types that are difficult to treat and poor developmental outcomes. There is considerable evidence that genetic mutations cause childhood epileptic encephalopathies and our recent research has identified several new genetic causes. However most cases are still not explained. This research will identify new genes and genetic pathways in epilepsy. Furthermore we will study the specific genetic changes disrupt normal brain function.

The childhood epileptic encephalopathies (CEE) are the most severe types of epilepsy characterized by refractory seizures cognitive arrest or regression associated with ongoing epileptic activity and a poor prognosis. Identifying the genetic causes of CEE is the initial step toward developing more effective diagnostic tests prognosis counseling and treatments. Despite significant advances in gene discovery in recent years the majority of patient with CEE remain undiagnosed. Our recent work (R01NS069605) to investigate the genetic basis of epilepsy helped establish the role of copy number variants (CNVs) in CEE. More recently we use a high-throughput targeted sequencing strategy to screen 73 known and candidate CEE genes for mutations in a cohort of >500 CEE probands identifying pathogenic mutations in >10% of patients. Our studies identified CHD2 and SYNGAP1 as novel and important causes of CEE GRIN2A as a cause of epilepsy-aphasia syndromes and GABRA1 and STXBP1 as causes of a subset of SCN1A- negative Dravet syndrome. In this proposal we build upon these successes and propose three lines of investigation. First we will use trio exome sequencing in 150 patients with CEE who have already been screened for mutations in a large number of CEE genes and are therefore enriched for gene discovery. Second we will use high-throughput targeted of a panel of CEE and ID genes to investigate the role of these genes in several related neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Finally we will investigate the role of the chromatin remodeling pathway in epileptogenesis highlighted by the discovery of CHD2 mutations in a subset of CEE patients. Successful completion of our aims will lead to improved genetic diagnosis of patients better prognosis and recurrence risk counseling for families and novel targets for development of therapeutics.,607664

Idiopathic generalized epilepsy(IGE) has been recognized asits genetic origins which include many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or mutation ofionotropic receptors such as GABAergic receptor (GABAR) subunit mutations (Gabrg2Q390X andGabra1A322D) linked to severe Dravet epilepsy syndrome and child absence epilepsy andcognitive comorbidity in patients. In contrast to acquired seizures study IGE seizure andepileptogenesis mechanism remains largely elusive. Moreover seizures and sleepinfluence/interact with each other in their physiology mechanism which imposes a challenge toIGE study and patient treatment. In one recent human patient study sleep-like slow-waveoscillation has been shown to facilitate epileptic seizure activity. Therefore we hypothesize thatsleep-related slow-wave hyperpolarization-depolarization oscillation(SWO) can drivehomeostatic potentiation(HSP) of excitatory synaptic currents not inhibitory synaptic currents incortical neurons of thalamocortical circuitry in IGE animal models with Gabrg2Q390X orGabra1A322D mutation and therefore create an escaped excitatory synaptic currents (withoutbalancing from inhibitory synaptic currents) in cortical neurons during sleep and sleep-waketransition. This critical step of gabaergic current HSP impairment induced by SWOs can lead toseizure occurrence/initiation and also contribute to epileptogenesis in IGE models. This work willfill a critical void in our understanding of seizure mechanism plus epileptogenesis andpotentially generate a new seizure therapy. First we will study whether SWO-induced HSP ofinhibitory GABAR-mediated currents is impaired but not excitatory AMPAR-mediated currentsin layer V-VI cortical neurons in vitro from heterozygous Gabrg2+/Q390X or Gabra1+/A322D knock-inmice and whether this impairment results in neuronal elevated firing. Second we will determinewhether light-induced SWOs in vivo causally initiate epileptic activity in cortex from miceexpressing halorhodopsin (NpHR) and Gabrg2Q390X or Gabra1A322D mutation. Last we will use aretinoid acid synthesis blocker DEAB to maintain the dynamic HSP balance between synapticexcitatory and inhibitory currents during SWOs in IGE models which will provide a proof ofprinciple for a potential seizure therapy. The information generated in these studies willsubstantially alter our view of seizure/epileptogenesis regarding its interaction with sleep wavesand eventually lead to a new seizure therapy in IGE patients.,237000

This proposal is based on our discovery that hyperthermic seizures are driven by nimodipine-sensitive calcium channels and that nimodipine treatment prevents febrile seizures in nave rodents. We will determine whether the same calcium channels are responsible for the temperature-dependent hyperexcitability in nave animals and in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome and test the efficacy of nimodipine a drug with excellent safety record to prevent/stop seizures in the mouse model of Dravet syndrome.,NINDS,9229071,2/20/2017 0:00,PA-13-303,5R21NS096424-02,5,R21,NS,96424,2, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",3/1/2016 0:00,2/28/2019 0:00,Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section[CNNT], ,7839393,"MARTINA, MARCO ",Not Applicable,5,PHYSIOLOGY,5436803,KG76WYENL5K1,5436803,KG76WYENL5K1,US,42.050479,-87.680046,6144650,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,606114579,UNITED STATES,N,3/1/2017 0:00,2/28/2019 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2017,193125, ,NINDS,125000,68125, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Febrile seizures affect up to 5% of children under the age of 5 and are the most common seizures in children of this age group. Current treatment of febrile seizures is limited and inadequate often resulting in long uncontrolled seizures. Clinicalobservations suggest a possible etiologic link between early life prolonged febrile seizures and later development of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Despite increased risk of epilepsy in children with febrile seizures these seizures are routinely not treated with anticonvulsants even if they are recurrent. In the past phenobarbital had been used for over 25 years as prophylaxis in the treatment of recurrent febrile seizures but anticonvulsant prophylaxis is no longer recommended because side effects appeared to outweigh the potential benefits. One of the main hurdles to the design of effective treatments is that despite their obvious association with hyperthermia the detailed molecular mechanisms of febrile seizures remain unclear. This proposal is based on our observation that a temperature dependent increase in intrinsic neuronal excitability driven by L-type voltage-gated calcium channels plays a critical role in the generation of febrile seizures in naive rodents. We will use patch clamp recordings and single-cell RT-PCR from acute slices to characterize the precise molecular identity of the channels involved and test the hypothesis that the same channels are also critical mediators of hyperthermic depolarization in neurons obtained from Scn1atm1Kea mice an animal model of Dravet syndrome. Further experiments will test the hypothesis that nimodipine can prevent the development of seizures in slices obtained from the Dravet syndrome mice. We will investigate the effect of bath applied nimodipine on the temperature threshold frequency and magnitude of the epileptic discharges. Finally we will use behavioral analysis and EEG recordings to test the efficacy of nimodipine for the treatment of seizures in the rodent model of Dravet syndrome. If successful these experiments may have immediate translational relevance because dihydropyridines have been used for decades in clinical context for the treatment of high blood pressure with negligible adverse effects. Therefore it is likely that the use of nimodipine for thetreatment or prevention of febrile seizures would be devoid of negative side effects and that this compound could be used for the treatment of all types of febrile seizures including those in Dravet patients for which novel pharmacological treatments are badly needed.,193125

Despite the development of mouse models pathophysiological mechanisms for these disorders are poorly understood. One particularly devastating channelopathy is Dravet Syndrome (DS) a severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy typically caused by de novo dominant mutations in SCN1A encoding the voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) Nav1.1. Heterologous expression of mutant channels suggests haploinsufficiency raising the question of how loss of VGSCs underlying action potentials (APs) produces hyperexcitability. Data from DS mouse models indicate both decreased Na+ current in interneurons implicating disinhibition and increased Na+ current in pyramidal cells implicating hyperexcitability depending on genetic background brain area and animal age. To understand the effects of SCN1A DS mutations in human neurons we derived forebrain-like neurons from two DS subjects by induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming of patient fibroblasts and compared them with iPSC-derived neurons from human controls. We found that DS patient-derived neurons have increased Na+ current density in both bipolar- and pyramidal-shaped neurons. Consistent with increased Na+ current both putative excitatory and inhibitory patient-derived neurons showed spontaneous bursting and other evidence of hyperexcitability. Our data provided some of the first evidence that epilepsy patient-specific neurons obtained via the iPSC method are useful for modeling epileptic-like hyperactivity. Moreover our findings revealed a previously unrecognized potential epilepsy mechanism underlying DS and offered a platform for future screening of novel anti-epileptic therapies using patient-derived neurons. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular basis of genetic epilepsies. Our objective is to determine epilepsy mechanisms of SCN1A-linked DS in humans. We will test the central hypothesis that SCN1A haploinsufficiency leads to paradoxically increased Na+ current in excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as alterations in other ionic currents that underlie neuronal hyperexcitability in DS. The rationale fr this work is that identifying the role of SCN1A haploinsufficiency in the development of hyperexcitability may lead to novel treatments for DS as well as related pediatric epilepsies. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1: To determine whether SCN1A haploinsufficiency causes alterations in the expression of other VGSC -subunits that lead to increased Na+ current in DS patient-specific iPSC neurons. 2: To investigate changes in synaptic function in DS patient-specific iPSC neurons. 3: To determine the electrophysiological characteristics of DS patient-specific and control iPSC neurons differentiated in the rodent brain.This work is expected to reveal how SCN1A haploinsufficiency contributes to epilepsy in humans. Our results will have positive impact because this work will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of DS and related diseases and may lead to novel therapeutic agents for epilepsy.,535154

In this proposal we will use knock-in Drosophila with SCN1A mutations and iPSC-derived neurons from patients with the same mutations to explore the underlying disease mechanisms.

These include Dravet Syndrome (DS) and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Both DS and GEFS+ are autosomal dominant disorders but relatively little is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying seizure generation. Here we propose to assess the functional consequences of disease causing mutations on neuronal activity using two complementary genetic model systems: knock-in Drosophila with SCN1A mutations and iPSC-derived neurons from patients with the same mutations. Our preliminary data demonstrate that knock-in of a GEFS+ SCN1A mutation (K1270T) into the Drosophila sodium channel gene para causes a semi-dominant temperature-induced seizure phenotype. Electrophysiological studies of GABAergic interneurons in the brains of adult GEFS+ flies reveal a novel cellular mechanism underlying heat-induced seizure. Consistent with disease symptoms in humans the seizure phenotype caused by knock-in of a DS mutation (S1231R) is more severe than GEFS+. The congruence of the genotype-to-phenotype map between flies and human in this genetic disease model paves the way for use of knock-in Drosophila to study the mechanisms underlying these complex human genetic disorders. The first two aims are focused on use of Drosophila sodium channel knock-in lines to further explore the underlying cellular mechanisms contributing to heat-induced seizures and as a low cost high efficiency platform for discovery of genetic modifiers and drugs that suppress the seizure phenotype. In specific Aim 3 we will employ our expertise in stem cell biology to conduct parallel studies of neuronal activity in iPSC-derived neurons from patients with the same GEFS+ mutations examined in knock-in flies. Identification of common cellular mechanisms in these two model systems has the potential to identify targets for development of novel therapies to reduce or eliminate seizures in humans with epilepsy.,526152

The work in this proposal investigates whether the response to anti-epileptic drugs in 3 mouse models of genetic epilepsy may be due to the action of these drugs on specific inhibitory neurons and networks. Completion of this research has the potential to significantly improve drug development and patient care.,NINDS,9207024,2/22/2017 0:00,PA-14-046,5K08NS096029-02,5,K08,NS,96029,2, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",4/1/2016 0:00,3/31/2021 0:00,NST-1 Study Section[NST-1], ,11682668,"MAHESHWARI, ATUL ",Not Applicable,9,NEUROLOGY,51113330,FXKMA43NTV21,51113330,FXKMA43NTV21,US,29.70926,-95.400851,481201,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,TX,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,770303411,UNITED STATES,N,4/1/2017 0:00,3/31/2018 0:00,853,Other Research-Related,2017,189832, ,NINDS,176234,13598, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anti-epileptic drug resistance is a major obstacle to the clinical management of seizure disorders and affects one third of patients with epilepsy. In addition patients with genetic generalized epilepsy do not have the option of epilepsy surgery. The focus of this project is to explore the cellular and network basis of anti-epileptic drug response in genetic generalized epilepsy. The candidate has a strong clinical background in epilepsy and has developed significant preliminary work which forms the basis for the proposed research. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that interictal relative gamma power (30-100 Hz) may predict anti-epileptic drug response in absence epilepsy and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet Syndrome) due to the effect of these drugs on fast-spiking interneurons. The stargazer and tottering mouse models of epilepsy as well as the Scn1a heterozygous knock-in model of Dravet Syndrome are ideal for studying this hypothesis since they have mutations which have been associated with fast-spiking interneuron deficits and these interneurons are critical for the generation of neocortical gamma rhythms. In addition these models are known to have paradoxical seizure exacerbation with certain anti-epileptic drugs. In this project using in vivo 2-photon microscopy and simultaneous EEG post-hoc immunohistochemistry and in vivo video-EEG monitoring sampling at 2 kHz the specific aims of this project are to: (1) Determine the neocortical cell-specific and local network responses to anti-epileptic drugs in vivo in 3 models of genetic generalized epilepsy and (2) Evaluate the effect of anti-epileptic drugs on interictal EEG power between 2-300 Hz in vivo in the same 3 models of genetic generalized epilepsy. This proposal merges the techniques of computational analysis of EEG previously acquired under the mentorship of Sydney Cash MD PhD and more recent techniques acquired under the ongoing mentorship of Jeffrey Noebels MD PhD (primary mentor) who provides expertise in neurogenesis and Stelios Smirnakis MD PhD (co-mentor) who provides expertise in 2-photon imaging. In the short term the candidate has assembled a gap-based plan for rigorous training and coursework focusing on developing expertise in 2-photon imaging and patch-clamp techniques in vivo statistical modelling and analysis and translational research methodology while also learning about and treating patients with epilepsy in a clinical context. In the long term with a strong institutional commitment and abundant resources available in the Texas Medical Center this training will aid in the candidate's development as an independent clinician- scientist with a unique focus on diminishing pharmacoresistance in patients with epilepsy. Ultimately the completion of this research will shed new light on the mechanisms of genetic generalized epilepsy and can directly lead to improved drug development and patient care.,189832

We recently began to explore the possibility that single-gene mutations in zebrafish can be used to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of DS. Zebrafish mutants featuring a loss-of- function sodium channel (SCN1A) mutation (e.g. a gene family commonly identified in children with DS) were identified and characterized by our laboratory as epileptic zebrafish with phenotypes similar to the human condition. Using automated behavioral tracking and in vivo electrophysiology assays we screened more than 1300 compounds using these fish. With the data generated we now propose to extend this research program to include novel DS zebrafish mutants additional high-throughput screening and mechanistic analysis of a small molecule lead compound that emerged from the first screening effort. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) to generate and characterize zebrafish DS mutants (ii) to perform high-throughput drug screening using zebrafish DS mutants and (iii) to examine the mechanism of action for clemizole in DS mutants. Techniques will include automated locomotion tracking in vivo zebrafish electrophysiology recording pharmacology CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and calcium imaging using genetically encoded calcium indicators. Our results promise to advance our long-term goal to better understand the pathophysiology of genetic epilepsies and identify promising new treatment options for these intractable conditions.,346719

This is due largely to the lack of good modelsystems and tools to rapidly study relevant electrical and synaptic phenotypes. We aim toovercome these challenges. Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)technology reveal the first prospects for studying human neurons paired with clinical historiesusing fast in vitro technologies. The complex electrophysiological behavior of these cell can berecorded with the Optopatch platform and microscope systems recently developed at Q-State.With these tools it is possible to simultaneously stimulate (blue light) and record (red light)electrical activity from around a hundred neurons with one millisecond temporal resolutionsingle cell spatial resolution and high signal to noise. This system can be used to measuresingle cell excitability and firing patters or to probe synaptic transmission by stimulating a subsetof neurons with spatially patterned blue light. Moving forward we propose to increasemicroscope throughput without sacrificing capabilities and rigorously test the platformsperformance. First the microscope will be upgraded with advanced environmental controls 96-well plate compatibility and a fluid-handling robot for compound addition. Next data storageand analysis will be securely moved to the cloud to handle 2.5 Terabyte/day data rates. Oncethe microscope is fully functional sensitivity and reproducibility (well to well plate to plate andbatch to batch) will be tested using a library of control compounds. Finally as a first applicationwe will search for a robust screenable phenotype for Dravet syndrome. Neurons will beprepared from ten healthy and ten Dravet patients to look for differences in firing that transcendvariation in the genetic background. A drug that ameliorates the disease phenotype in themajority of cell lines is a promising candidate to be broadly effective in the clinic. A wellvalidated high-throughput electrophysiology platform with confirmed phenotypic readouts inhuman iPSC disease neurons has the potential to change the drug screening landscape forneurological disorders. We hope to open a new path to finding treatments for these horriblediseases.,676626

SCN1A mutations also lead to genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) aninherited disorder characterized by early-life FSs and the development of a wide range of adult epilepsysubtypes. Current anti-epilepsy drugs often fail to provide adequate protection against the severe seizures andneuropsychiatric comorbidities that occur in patients with SCN1A mutations. Furthermore almost a third of allepilepsy patients do not achieve adequate seizure control highlighting the urgent need to develop multimodaltreatments that can effectively mitigate the broad spectrum of clinical features associated with refractoryepilepsies while minimizing unwanted side effects. In this exploratory R21 proposal we will test the hypothesisthat Huperzine A (Hup A) a naturally occurring sesquiterpene Lycopodium alkaloid will be efficacious in thetreatment of DS. This hypothesis is based on the biological properties of Hup A its demonstrated clinicalsafety tolerability ability to improve cognitive function and our preliminary data. We will use heterozygousScn1a knockout mice (a model of DS) to evaluate the potential of Hup A to increase seizure thresholds andprevent spontaneous seizure generation (Aim 1) and to ameliorate cognitive and behavioral deficits (Aim 2).This clinically relevant proposal could lay the foundation for the development of a novel therapy to treatSCN1A-derived epilepsies. Furthermore since SCN1A mutations lead to reduced neuronal inhibition which isa shared mechanism underlying many common forms of epilepsy the outcome of this study may haveimportant broad implications for the treatment of refractory epilepsies.,232624

Equally devastating intellectual and behavioraldisabilities severely disrupt quality of life for patients and caregivers and have no effective therapy. Classicallyintellectual impairments have been considered a direct effect of uncontrolled seizures and research has beentargeted at improving seizure control. Recent work in systems neurophysiology suggests that specific patternsof brain activity so-called brain rhythms underlie cognition and that disruption of these rhythms impairsintellectual ability. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether loss-of-function mutations inScn1a are sufficient to disrupt SWR and whether spatial memory is impaired in parallel. To determine whetherseizures contribute to spatial memory impairment to determine whether restoration of Scn1a expression withgene therapy recovers normal SWR features and improves spatial memory we will use existing DS mousemodels and generate a novel DS model in which Scn1a expression can be recovered in a previously affectedmouse a genetic `cure'.

Current drug therapies are ineffective at controlling seizures and no therapy exists forsevere cognitive deficits. While seizure frequency and severity often improves children with DS who surviveinto their teenage years have IQs in the severely impaired range 50 to 70 and typically require permanentinstitutional or family care. Therapy for cognitive impairment would dramatically improve the lives of thesepatients substantially reduce long-term care costs and reduce accidental deaths. Work in genetic mousemodels which are faithful genocopies and phenocopies shows that inhibitory interneuron but not excitatorycell activity is impaired resulting in an in-balance between excitation and inhibition the likely cause of seizuresand co-morbidities. An emerging principle from systems-level neuroscience is that cognition depends onprecisely timed electrophysiologic patterns brain rhythms. Whether disrupted brain rhythms contribute tocognitive impairment in human disease and whether interventions targeted at normalization of rhythmsthrough pharmaceuticals targeted stimulation or via correction of genetic defect are a reasonable therapeuticstrategy remains to be determined. Hippocampal sharp - wave / ripple (SWR) complexes contribute to spatiallearning and memory and require high frequency temporally precise action potential firing in inhibitoryinterneurons. We hypothesize that: Decreased SWR recurrence and slowed intra-ripple frequency arecaused by hippocampal interneuron hypoexcitability and contribute to spatial memory impairment inDS mice. The proposed experiments will: (1) extend the preliminary finding of decreased ripple recurrence andslowed intra-ripple frequency in DS mice comparing SWR features by sleep-wake state and during context-dependent spatial learning to determine if rate of SWR occurrence and intra-ripple frequency are correlatedwith Scn1a expression and memory performance (2) determine whether spatial memory impairment ismediated through effects of reduced Scn1a expression reduced Na current and hypoexcitability of forebrainGABAergic interneurons (3) determine whether seizures contribute to spatial memory impairment and alteredSWR features and (4) determine whether altered SWR features and impaired spatial memory can benormalized with restoration of Na channel expression. This work will be organized around the following specificaims: Aim 1: Dependence of SWR recurrence intra-ripple frequency and spatial memory impairmenton Scn1a expression Aim 2: Contribution of seizures to reduced SWR occurrence slowed intra-ripplefrequency and spatial memory impairment,337969

Most concerning are the severe seizures and high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Mutations in voltage-gated Na+ channel  and  subunit genes are linked to DS.

Most concerning are the severe seizures and high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Mutations in voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC)  and  subunit genes are linked to DS. While the majority of DS cases are linked to SCN1A haploinsufficiency SCN1B homozygous mutations are also linked to DS (or a DS-like EE). The objective of this work is to understand the mechanism of hyperexcitability in human SCN1B-linked DS/EE. It is hypothesized that the mechanism of Scn1b signaling in neurons involves cell type and subcellular domain specific changes in Na+ current (INa) and K+ current (IK) as well as cell adhesion-mediated effects on neuronal pathfinding and transcriptional regulation of ion channels and transporters. It is proposed that human SCN1B-DS mutations result in defects in neuronal cell-cell communication and ionic currents that are similar to those observed in Scn1b-/- mice. Three Specific Aims are designed to test this hypothesis: 1. To determine whether human SCN1B-linked DS mutations result in loss-of-function in vivo. SCN1B-DS mutations are assumed to result in a functional null phenotype however this has not been tested in vivo. A family with an inherited recessive SCN1B-DS mutation has donated skin biopsies for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation. This mutation as well as the previously identified SCN1B-R125C human mutation will be introduced into the mouse Scn1b locus to test homozygous progeny for changes in excitability neuronal pathfinding INa IK and GABAergic signaling in comparison with Scn1b-/- mice. In parallel SCN1B-linked human DS iPSC neurons and cerebral organoids will be generated and tested for similar deficits. Gene editing will be used to make isogenic controls and to generate homozygous null patient-derived neurons to directly compare SCN1B-DS mutant and null cells in the same isogenic iPSC line of human neurons. 2. To determine localized changes in INa or IK in Scn1b-/- brain cortical slices. It is possible that the cause of seizures in SCN1B-DS is not disrupted neuronal pathfinding as previously proposed but instead neuronal subtype specific changes in INa or IK. Here a combination of nucleated patch pulled patches from the AIS and immunofluorescence staining will be used to determine differential changes in INa and VGSC expression in -/- vs. +/+ cortex. Changes in IK and voltage-gated K+ channel (VGKC) expression will also be tested. 3. To determine whether disruption of Scn1b-mediated neuronal pathfinding plays a role in hyperexcitability in DS. Scn1b-/- mice have neuronal pathfinding defects that precede seizure onset. It was proposed that these defects might lead to the development of seizures. An inducible pan-neuronal Cre line will be used to delete Scn1b past the critical period of mouse brain development to determine whether seizures and early mortality occur as in Scn1b-/- mice. Here changes in INa IK neuronal patterning and GABAergic signaling will be investigated following Scn1b deletion at progressive developmental time points. 1-mediated neurite outgrowth requires trans homophilic 1-1 cell adhesion leading to intracellular association of 1 with ankG in vitro. In a second set of experiments mutations will be introduced to the mouse Scn1b locus that interrupt 1-ankG association or 1 tyrosine phosphorylation to ask whether disruption of the 1-CAM signaling cascade leads to seizures in vivo. Even though SCN1B- linked DS/EE is a rare disease this work is important because it will provide new information regarding how deficits in brain development and regulation of ionic currents can synergize to result in hyperexcitability.,532244

Cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory depression are both proposed to be mechanisms that lead to SUDEP however respiratory mechanisms have not been studied as extensively as cardiac causes.

There is a surprisingly common lack of awareness among patients and physicians of this increased risk of sudden death. In a recent survey only 56% of Canadian pediatricians who treat patients with epilepsy knew their patients were at increased risk for sudden death and only 33% of these physicians knew the term SUDEP. There is controversy regarding whether cardiac failure or respiratory arrest is more important as the primary cause of death but cardiac and respiratory data is rarely collected simultaneously from human cases of SUDEP or from mouse models. For example in the more than 20 documented cases of SUDEP that occurred while the patient was undergoing EMU monitoring none of these patients had measurements of ventilation or even blood oxygenation. Effective preventive strategies in high-risk epileptic patients will rely on defining the mechanisms that lead from seizures to death. Our preliminary data suggest that respiratory depression is the primary cause of death in some cases of SUDEP and that patients with Dravet syndrome have previously uncharacterized breathing abnormalities in the peri-ictal period. Furthermore our data has indicated there is an anatomical pathway that inhibits ventilation which extends from the amygdala and anterior temporal lobe to medullary nuclei that control breathing. However it is unclear how this circuit is connected and the identities of the neurons involved. In Aim 1 we will characterize peri-ictal cardiorespiratory control in human patients with Dravet syndrome as well as mouse models of this pathology. In Aim 2 we will define the anatomical pathway from the amygdala to the brainstem that inhibits the cardiovascular and respiratory control networks during seizures. Finally in Aim 3 we will determine the identity of brainstem neurons that receive inputs from the amygdala and inhibit breathing and consciousness during seizures. This work will identify an anatomical pathway by which cortical seizures can invade the midbrain and brainstem and cause depressed cardiorespiratory function and arousal. Our findings have the potential to characterize key components of this circuit and may identify biomarkers that can be used to develop effective screening strategies. Better understanding mechanisms that underlie SUDEP will allow future development of preventative treatments that may decrease SUDEP risk.,637998

Until now there has not been an organized clinical network specifically focused on individuals at high risk for SUDEP. Moreover there is a lack of unified clinical monitoring algorithms that will stratify SUDEP risk i patient population allow in-depth correlative analysis with brain morphometric studies and genetic investigations and inform model systems of premature epilepsy mortality. We therefore propose a Clinical Network Core (SRA-CNC) that consists of four principal components: (1) a Pediatric Clinical Network (PCN) aimed at recruitment physiological monitoring and sample collection in children affected by Dravet syndrome (2) an Adult Clinical Network (ACN) focused on high SUDEP risk adult patients based on the combined phenotype of epilepsy cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory dysfunction (3) Analysis Center entails physiological morphometric and epidemiological evaluations of the human data and (4) Data integration and storage. The SRA-CNC will perform four main functions; (1) It will establish infrastructure logistical and regulatory support and implement standard operating procedures for case ascertainment scope and mode of physiological monitoring and data collection and procurement of biological specimens; (2) it will provide problem focused expert analysis of the (i) clinical and epidemiological data (ii) ictal cardiac and respiratory physiology and (iii) imaging based morphometry; (3) It will optimize resource utilization and facilitate data exchange analysis and communication among participating centers; and (4) SRA-CNC will translate investigational procedures into clinical practice in the form of public education and evidence driven recommendations.

The multiplicity of causes of the disease poses an obvious challenge to the development of a general therapeutic approach. Even when epilepsy is caused by a single gene alteration such as in Dravet syndrome in humans the changes in the activity of the affected neurons can be too severe to be successfully targeted by the existing drugs. Our findings revealed a novel signaling control mechanism that has a major potential for the treatment of epilepsy. The ability of the brain-enriched microRNA miR-128 to modulate the activity of signaling networks that include many of the epilepsy-linked signaling proteins points to a potential use of a miR-128 based therapy for epilepsy treatment.,NINDS,9128770,7/20/2016 0:00,PA-13-302,5R01NS091574-02,5,R01,NS,91574,2, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",9/1/2015 0:00,8/31/2019 0:00,"Neurotransporters, Receptors, and Calcium Signaling Study Section[NTRC]", ,9344236,"SCHAEFER, ANNE ",Not Applicable,13,NEUROSCIENCES,78861598,C8H9CNG1VBD9,78861598,C8H9CNG1VBD9,US,40.790284,-73.946781,3839801,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,100296574,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2016 0:00,8/31/2017 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2016,369434, ,NINDS,218750,150684, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current project addresses a novel regulatory mechanism of neuronal activity by microRNAs and its role in controlling animal behavior and epilepsy. We found that a neuron-enriched microRNA miR-128 acts as a negative master modulator of neuronal signaling responses in mice. The importance of the miR-128 in brain function is underscored by the development of fatal epileptic seizures in mice that lack miR-128 in postnatal forebrain neurons. Accordingly overexpression of miR-128 in neurons attenuates chemically-induced seizures and rescues survival in mice. These findings reveal miR-128 as a previously unknown key regulator of neuronal activity with a potential for the development of novel anti-epileptic therapeutic approaches. The major regulatory function of miR-128 highlights the importance of the mechanisms that control miR-128 expression levels as well as miR-128 access to its targets in neurons. We found that calcineurin/NFAT activity an important signaling pathway in neuronal development and function controls miR-128 expression in neurons. Most importantly mice with neuronal calcineurin deficiency develop a fatal seizure syndrome similar to the one observed in mice with miR-128 deficiency. These findings provided a strong indication for the role of calcineurin/NFAT signaling in control of miR-128 expression. The mechanism of calcineurin/NFAT-mediated regulation of miR-128 expression will be addressed in this proposal. The proposal also addresses a novel mechanism of regulation of miR-128 effector function. Preliminary data suggest that access of miR-128 to its mRNA targets is regulated by miR-128-sequestring non-coding decoy RNAs. This novel mechanism of regulation of miR-128 effector function will be explored in experiments using unique mouse models with inactivation or overexpression of the neuron-specific miR-128 decoy RNAs in combination with the molecular electrophysiological and behavioral approaches that have been established in our laboratory. The central role of miR-128 in neuronal signaling makes this miRNA an attractive target for potential therapeutic intervention of epilepsy. Using a mouse model of the human Dravet syndrome one the most severe and often treatment resistant forms of epilepsy the proposal will explore the therapeutic potential of neuronal miR-128 modulation for the treatment of the disease. To bring the research closer to the development of actual antiepileptic therapy we will explore the antiepileptic potential of exogenously expressed miR-128. MiR-128 will be delivered to defined neurons using neurotrophic adeno-associated viruses (AAV) that are currently considered as the most reliable vehicle for in vivo gene delivery in mice and human. In summary our proposal describes highly innovative and hypothesis driven studies of a novel non-coding RNA mechanism for controlling neuronal signaling and activity that has a strong potential to be applied for the treatment of human epilepsy.,369434

The neural bases for sleep disorders in DS are unknown in part because until recently there were no animal models for this disease. The main goal of this grant is to study the mechanisms underlying these sleep disorders using a recently developed mouse model of DS.,NINDS,9128731,7/18/2016 0:00,PA-13-302,5R01NS094211-02,5,R01,NS,94211,2, ,"HE, JANET",9/1/2015 0:00,8/31/2019 0:00,"Neuroendocrinology, Neuroimmunology, Rhythms and Sleep Study Section[NNRS]", ,8146532,"DE LA IGLESIA, HORACIO O",Not Applicable,7,BIOLOGY,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2016 0:00,8/31/2017 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2016,337969, ,NINDS,218750,119219, ,   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Animals carrying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the Scn1a gene (Scn1a+/- mice) which encodes a subunit of the voltage-gated Na+ channel NaV1.1 show deficits in both homeostatic regulation of sleep and circadian regulation of rest-activity cycles. The NaV1.1 channel is the primary voltage-gated Na+ channel in adult GABAergic interneurons and its reduced activity results in a decrease of GABAergic tone suggesting that sleep regulatory deficits in Scn1a+/- mice emerge from reduced GABAergic activity. However Scn1a+/- mice are a model of a severe form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome (DS) and as DS patients show not only dysregulation of sleep but also generalized seizures. Epileptic activity complicates the interpretation of sleep disorders in DS as sleep regulatory deficits could be the result of sleep disruption by seizures or of seizure-associated neural damage. Our hypothesis is that sleep disorders in DS are the consequence of reduced GABAergic tone within sleep regulatory centers that is independent of the presence of seizures. To address this hypothesis we propose to conditionally target the Scn1a+/- mutation to specific neurons and brain regions. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether sleep abnormalities in global Scn1a+/- mice emerge from the effect of the mutation specifically on GABAergic neurons. We will target the Scn1a+/- mutation to these cells using an Scn1alox/- mouse and a Cre driver mouse line that targets GABAergic neurons throughout the brain and will assess the integrity of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep in these mutants. This approach will unequivocally determine whether sleep regulatory deficits in Scn1a+/- mice are the result of reduced NaV1.1 channel activity within GABAergic cells or whether non- GABAergic cells that express the channel also contribute to this phenotype. Specific Aim 2 will target the Scn1a+/- mutation to cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) the site of the central circadian pacemaker that regulates sleep. Viruses expressing Cre recombinase targeting either all SCN cells or specifically vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-containing cells will be injected wihin the SCN of Scn1alox/+ mice. We will also target the mutation to the SCN VIPergic cells by crossing Scn1alox/+ mice with a mouse line in which the VIP promoter drives the expression of Cre. Because VIP neurons are essential for the integrity of the SCN oscillatory network we expect that these VIP-specific Scn1a+/- mutants will show similar effects to mutants in which all SCN cells are targeted. Specific Aim 3 will virally target the Scn1a+/- mutation to the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RNT) which is essential for the generation of slow-wave sleep and spindles during non- REM sleep both compromised in Scn1a+/- mice. None of the conditional mutant approaches in Aims 1 and 2 is expected to induce seizures offering a unique opportunity to assess the effect of reduced NaV1.1 channel activity in sleep regulatory regions in the absence of seizures. We predict that the conditional targeting of the Scn1a+/- mutation to the SCN and RNT will lead to deficits in circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep respectively. These results would provide direct support for the role of the NaV1.1 channel within these brain regions in the regulation of sleep.

We have developed a mouse genetic model with all the features of DS including susceptibility to thermally induced seizures and spontaneous seizures ataxia circadian rhythm and sleep disorders cognitive deficit autistic-like features and premature death. All these effects are correlated with loss of Na currents and excitability of GABAergic interneurons without effects on excitatory neurons which causes imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neural circuits. Mutation of Nav1.1 channels specifically in forebrainGABAergic interneurons by the Cre-Lox method is sufficient to cause the major DS symptoms confirming that DS is caused by loss of Nav1.1 channels in inhibitory neurons. Remarkably cognitive deficit and autistic-like behaviors of DS mice can be rescued by treatment with a low dose of the GABA-A receptor co-activator clonazepam demonstrating that these life- changing co-morbidities are caused by the mutation of Nav1.1 channels rather than by neuronal damage from recurrent seizures. Our central hypothesis is that epilepsy and co-morbidities in DS result from failure of excitability of GABAergic inhibitory neurons which creates an imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neural circuits and that re-balancing excitation and inhibition with rug treatment will have therapeutic value. To further advance understanding of pathophysiology and treatment of DS we propose four experimental approaches. (i) We will examine hyperexcitability of cells and circuits using specific deletion of Nav1.1 channels in different classes of interneurons in specific brain regions by the Cre-Lox method. We will use brain slice recording methods to document changes in excitability of cells and circuits. (ii) We will use immunocytochemical and mouse genetic approaches to identify the sites of hyperexcitability that appear first in DS mice in vivo and thereby determine the time course of changes in excitability of cells and circuits that lead to epilepsy. (iii) Patients with DS have prolonged episodes of status epilepticus. We will induce status epilepticus in DS mice by thermal stimulation and determine the changes in excitability of cells and circuits. We will assess cell injury by measurements of reactive astrocytes neuroinflammation apoptosis and neuronal cell death. (iv) Our results indicate that rationally designed drug combinations that increase GABAergic neurotransmission are effective in reducing seizures and premature death in DS mice with minimal side effects and that a single low-dose clonazepam treatment can rescue cognitive deficit and autistic-like behaviors. We will optimize combination therapy with a benzodiazepine plus tiagabine in order to develop a therapeutic regimen that prevents seizures premature death and cognitive impairment and minimizes effects of tolerance on prolonged therapy. We will examine new-generation subtype-selective GABA-A receptor activators and test effectiveness of these therapies approaches to control seizures and co-morbidities in DS mice.,337969

Most such epilepsy syndromes are rather benign and are outgrown as patient age. However truncation mutations in the GABAA receptor gamma2 subunit gene GABRgamma2 are often but not always associated with a more severe phenotype Dravet syndrome (DS). To date most DS patients are associated with SCN1A loss of function mutations that result in impaired GABAergic interneuron activity and action potential firing. Synaptic GABAA receptors mediate inhibitory GABAergic transmission and characterizations of DS mouse model harboring GABRgamma2 (Q351X) mutation would provide new insights into the pathogenesis of DS as well as epilepsy in general. Combination of understandings from both SCN1A and GABRgamma2 mouse models will help pinpoint the final common pathophysiologic pathway on which two distinct groups of mutations converge. GABRgamma2 (Q351X) mutation is associated with two DS pedigrees. The heterozygous GABRgamma2 (Q351X) knockin (KI) mice which are patient condition recapitulate the major features of DS. The mice displayed multiple neurodevelopmental abnormalities and multiple forms of epilepsy including generalized tonic clonic epilepsy suggesting impaired synapse formation and function. Since simple GABRgamma2 gene knockout (KO) heterozygous mice do not have seizures this suggests that presence of the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunit protein and its related pathology contribute to the severe DS phenotype. We have previously demonstrated that the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunits were loss of function. Additionally the mutant protein accumulated intracellularly formed aggregates and imposed a dominant-negative effect on the wildtype subunits. The mutant aggregates were identified by mass spectrometry and the components of the aggregates were similar to those identified in inclusions found in neurodegenerative diseases such as the Lewy bodies characteristic of Parkinson's disease. Our pilot data demonstrated that the mutant protein also formed substantial aggregates in the heterozygous KI mice. The mutant subunits impaired GABAergic synaptogenesis and GABAergic transmission. The single quantum dot imaging indicated the synapse vs. extrasynapse distribution of GABAA receptors were altered in the mutant KI mice. We hypothesize that the accumulation and aggregation of the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunits impair synapse development and GABAergic transmission thus resulting in the severe phenotype as DS. In this proposal we will characterize in detail the mutant subunit accumulation aggregation and its impact on synapse formation stabilization connectivity and transmission. We will also characterize adaptive changes of wildtype GABAA receptor expression distribution mobility and turnover as well as neurobehaviors in the mutant GABRG2 (Q351X) heterozygous KI mice. We found overexpression of heat shock protein (Hsp)70 and Hsp40 reduced the total mutant and aggregated gamma2 subunit protein. We thus propose to test a novel therapeutic strategy by upregulating chaperones like Hsp70 and Hsp40 in the mutant KI mice.,345625

Although SUDEP is the most devastating consequence of epilepsy and the leading cause of epilepsy mortality astonishingly little is understood about its causes and no biomarkers exist to identify at risk epilepsy patients. To advance our understanding of these critical issues we will focus on Dravet Syndrome (DS) a severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy associated with a high SUDEP incidence. DS is most frequently caused by mutations in the voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) gene SCN1A encoding NaV1.1. As NaV1.1 is expressed in brain heart and peripheral nerves a compelling idea is that altered Na+ currents (INa) in DS cardiac myocytes (CMs) or autonomic neurons in addition to central neurons lead to arrhythmias and SUDEP. We used the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) method to derive central and peripheral neurons and CMs from fibroblasts of DS subjects. Preliminary data from DS patient CMs suggest that a subset of DS subjects shows abnormal CM INa and excitability. In studies of a DS human mutant SCN1A knock-in mouse model we observed spontaneous seizures and SUDEP increased ventricular CM INa density and ventricular arrhythmias at the time of SUDEP. Similarly we found increased ventricular CM INa density spontaneous seizures and SUDEP in a Scn1b null DS mouse model. Our work studies of Scn1a heterozygous null DS mice and clinical ECG studies in DS also show altered cardiac autonomic function. Thus we hypothesize that SUDEP in DS is caused by VGSC mutations that produce cardiac electrical and/or autonomic dysfunction in addition to brain dysfunction. Furthermore that combined insights from studies of DS patient-derived cells mouse models and patient peri-ictal ECG data will yield biomarkers of SUDEP risk in DS.  Four specific aims will test these hypotheses: 1) To understand the effects of DS-linked SCN1A mutations on cardiac excitability using DS patient iPSC-derived CMs and DS mice; 2) To determine how DS-linked SCN1A mutations influence the excitability of autonomic neurons cardiac autonomic innervation and autonomic control of cardiac function using DS patient iPSC-derived autonomic neurons and DS mice; 3) To investigate changes in autonomic excitability in a second mouse model of DS Scn1b null mice and in SCN1B-DS patient iPSC CMs and neurons; and 4) To determine whether cardiac electrical and/or autonomic function is altered in DS patients at baseline or peri-ictally. Our wor will synergize with the entire CWOW proposal to not only uncover SUDEP mechanisms in DS but also to provide advances in understanding SUDEP causes and biomarkers that will be applicable to other refractory epilepsies due to ion channelopathies and perhaps other etiologies. This work will also show proof-of-principle for the use of multiple platforms (cellularand clinical data from the same patients and multiple mouse models) to individualize SUDEP risk and develop patient-specific preventative treatments.",662650

Despite the development of mouse models pathophysiological mechanisms for these disorders are poorly understood. One particularly devastating channelopathy is Dravet Syndrome (DS) a severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy typically caused by de novo dominant mutations in SCN1A encoding the voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) Nav1.1. Heterologous expression of mutant channels suggests haploinsufficiency raising the question of how loss of VGSCs underlying action potentials (APs) produces hyperexcitability. Data from DS mouse models indicate both decreased Na+ current in interneurons implicating disinhibition and increased Na+ current in pyramidal cells implicating hyperexcitability depending on genetic background brain area and animal age. To understand the effects of SCN1A DS mutations in human neurons we derived forebrain-like neurons from two DS subjects by induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming of patient fibroblasts and compared them with iPSC-derived neurons from human controls. We found that DS patient-derived neurons have increased Na+ current density in both bipolar- and pyramidal-shaped neurons. Consistent with increased Na+ current both putative excitatory and inhibitory patient-derived neurons showed spontaneous bursting and other evidence of hyperexcitability. Our data provided some of the first evidence that epilepsy patient-specific neurons obtained via the iPSC method are useful for modeling epileptic-like hyperactivity. Moreover our findings revealed a previously unrecognized potential epilepsy mechanism underlying DS and offered a platform for future screening of novel anti-epileptic therapies using patient-derived neurons. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular basis of genetic epilepsies. Our objective is to determine epilepsy mechanisms of SCN1A-linked DS in humans. We will test the central hypothesis that SCN1A haploinsufficiency leads to paradoxically increased Na+ current in excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as alterations in other ionic currents that underlie neuronal hyperexcitability in DS. The rationale fr this work is that identifying the role of SCN1A haploinsufficiency in the development of hyperexcitability may lead to novel treatments for DS as well as related pediatric epilepsies. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1: To determine whether SCN1A haploinsufficiency causes alterations in the expression of other VGSC -subunits that lead to increased Na+ current in DS patient-specific iPSC neurons. 2: To investigate changes in synaptic function in DS patient-specific iPSC neurons. 3: To determine the electrophysiological characteristics of DS patient-specific and control iPSC neurons differentiated in the rodent brain.This work is expected to reveal how SCN1A haploinsufficiency contributes to epilepsy in humans. Our results will have positive impact because this work will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of DS and related diseases and may lead to novel therapeutic agents for epilepsy.      ",550309

Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have treatment resistant (refractory) seizures thereby presenting a major clinical challenge and burden. The most common form of refractory epilepsy is mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) characterized by spontaneous seizures neuropsychological deficits and hippocampal sclerosis. At present surgical resection of the epilepsy focus is the best treatment strategy for this disorder; however this procedure is only used in a subset of cases. Consequently there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatments.  Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) SCN1A SCN2A and SCN3A are associated with several epilepsy subtypes including Dravet syndrome (DS) and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Gain of function mutations in the VGSC SCN8A have recently identified in individuals with epileptic encephalopathies. However our laboratory has demonstrated that mice with Scn8a mutations that reduce channel activity or expression are more resistant to induced seizures when compared to their wild-type littermates. In addition we were able to dramatically ameliorate seizure severity and restore normal lifespans to Scn1a mutants that model DS and GEFS+ by either co-segregation of an Scn8a mutation or hippocampal knockdown of Scn8a expression. Since the hippocampus is the major site of seizure generation and morphological changes in MTLE we hypothesize that selective reduction of SCN8A expression in the hippocampus will provide an effective strategy for the treatment of MTLE. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will establish the effect on spontaneous seizure frequency and severity of reducing hippocampal Scn8a expression in the widely used intra-hippocampal kainic acid mouse model of MTLE. Reduced Scn8a expression will be achieved by hippocampal injection of an adeno-associated viral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA against Scn8a (AAV-3). Seizure activity will be monitored in AAV-3 treated mice using continuous video/EEG analysis and will be compared to control mice injected with a scrambled construct (AAV-GFP). In Aim 2 we will determine if hippocampal reduction of Scn8a expression could also prevent or ameliorate the changes in behavior and hippocampal morphology and that are observed in this model of MTLE. Finally in Aim 3 we compare the biophysical properties of hippocampal slices from the AAV-3 and AAV-GFP treated mice in order to directly examine neuronal excitability. We will also test if partial pharmacological block of Nav1.6 using novel compounds can reduce seizure-like bursting activity in hippocampal slices from the MTLE mouse model and we will explore the contribution of the different VGSCs to the development of MTLE. This clinically relevant proposal will provide important insight into the feasibility of targeting SCN8A as a treatment for MTLE and more broadly for other forms of refractory epilepsy.,465815

This proposal is based on our discovery that hyperthermic seizures are driven by nimodipine-sensitive calcium channels and that nimodipine treatment prevents febrile seizures in nave rodents. We will determine whether the same calcium channels are responsible for the temperature-dependent hyperexcitability in nave animals and in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome and test the efficacy of nimodipine a drug with excellent safety record to prevent/stop seizures in the mouse model of Dravet syndrome.         ",NINDS,9086991,2/18/2016 0:00,PA-13-303,1R21NS096424-01,1,R21,NS,96424,1, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",3/1/2016 0:00,2/28/2018 0:00,Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section[CNNT], ,7839393,"MARTINA, MARCO ",Not Applicable,5,PHYSIOLOGY,5436803,KG76WYENL5K1,5436803,KG76WYENL5K1,US,42.050479,-87.680046,6144650,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,CHICAGO,IL,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,606114579,UNITED STATES,N,3/1/2016 0:00,2/28/2017 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2016,231750, ,NINDS,150000,81750, ,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Febrile seizures affect up to 5% of children under the age of 5 and are the most common seizures in children of this age group. Current treatment of febrile seizures is limited and inadequate often resulting in long uncontrolled seizures. Clinicalobservations suggest a possible etiologic link between early life prolonged febrile seizures and later development of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Despite increased risk of epilepsy in children with febrile seizures these seizures are routinely not treated with anticonvulsants even if they are recurrent. In the past phenobarbital had been used for over 25 years as prophylaxis in the treatment of recurrent febrile seizures but anticonvulsant prophylaxis is no longer recommended because side effects appeared to outweigh the potential benefits. One of the main hurdles to the design of effective treatments is that despite their obvious association with hyperthermia the detailed molecular mechanisms of febrile seizures remain unclear. This proposal is based on our observation that a temperature dependent increase in intrinsic neuronal excitability driven by L-type voltage-gated calcium channels plays a critical role in the generation of febrile seizures in naive rodents. We will use patch clamp recordings and single-cell RT-PCR from acute slices to characterize the precise molecular identity of the channels involved and test the hypothesis that the same channels are also critical mediators of hyperthermic depolarization in neurons obtained from Scn1atm1Kea mice an animal model of Dravet syndrome. Further experiments will test the hypothesis that nimodipine can prevent the development of seizures in slices obtained from the Dravet syndrome mice. We will investigate the effect of bath applied nimodipine on the temperature threshold frequency and magnitude of the epileptic discharges. Finally we will use behavioral analysis and EEG recordings to test the efficacy of nimodipine for the treatment of seizures in the rodent model of Dravet syndrome. If successful these experiments may have immediate translational relevance because dihydropyridines have been used for decades in clinical context for the treatment of high blood pressure with negligible adverse effects. Therefore it is likely that the use of nimodipine for thetreatment or prevention of febrile seizures would be devoid of negative side effects and that this compound could be used for the treatment of all types of febrile seizures including those in Dravet patients for which novel pharmacological treatments are badly needed.      ",231750

In addition patients with genetic generalized epilepsy do not have the option of epilepsy surgery. The focus of this project is to explore the cellular and network basis of anti-epileptic drug response in genetic generalized epilepsy. The candidate has a strong clinical background in epilepsy and has developed significant preliminary work which forms the basis for the proposed research. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that interictal relative gamma power (30-100 Hz) may predict anti-epileptic drug response in absence epilepsy and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet Syndrome) due to the effect of these drugs on fast-spiking interneurons. The stargazer and tottering mouse models of epilepsy as well as the Scn1a heterozygous knock-in model of Dravet Syndrome are ideal for studying this hypothesis since they have mutations which have been associated with fast-spiking interneuron deficits and these interneurons are critical for the generation of neocortical gamma rhythms. In addition these models are known to have paradoxical seizure exacerbation with certain anti-epileptic drugs. In this project using in vivo 2-photon microscopy and simultaneous EEG post-hoc immunohistochemistry and in vivo video-EEG monitoring sampling at 2 kHz the specific aims of this project are to: (1) Determine the neocortical cell-specific and local network responses to anti-epileptic drugs in vivo in 3 models of genetic generalized epilepsy and (2) Evaluate the effect of anti-epileptic drugs on interictal EEG power between 2-300 Hz in vivo in the same 3 models of genetic generalized epilepsy. This proposal merges the techniques of computational analysis of EEG previously acquired under the mentorship of Sydney Cash MD PhD and more recent techniques acquired under the ongoing mentorship of Jeffrey Noebels MD PhD (primary mentor) who provides expertise in neurogenesis and Stelios Smirnakis MD PhD (co-mentor) who provides expertise in 2-photon imaging. In the short term the candidate has assembled a gap-based plan for rigorous training and coursework focusing on developing expertise in 2-photon imaging and patch-clamp techniques in vivo statistical modelling and analysis and translational research methodology while also learning about and treating patients with epilepsy in a clinical context. In the long term with a strong institutional commitment and abundant resources available in the Texas Medical Center this training will aid in the candidate's development as an independent clinician- scientist with a unique focus on diminishing pharmacoresistance in patients with epilepsy. Ultimately the completion of this research will shed new light on the mechanisms of genetic generalized epilepsy and can directly lead to improved drug development and patient care.      ",183570

Over 800 mutations in SCN1A encoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 have been reported patients. SCN1A mutations are associated with epilepsy phenotypes on the genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) spectrum. The GEFS+ spectrum ranges from simple febrile seizures on the mild end of the spectrum to Dravet syndrome on the severe end. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A result in Dravet syndrome an infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by a variety of seizure types developmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variable expressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by genetic modifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) model a number of features of Dravet syndrome including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reduced sodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons which is predicted to increase excitability due to failure of inhibition. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is stronglydependent on strain background. Scn1a+/- mice on the resistant 129 strain background (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrast Scn1a+/- mice on a (129xB6)F1 strain background (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality with 50% dying by 1 month of age. Based on the strain- dependent difference in phenotype we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severity. We recently mapped several modifier loci that influence premature lethality of Scn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal we will perform fine mapping and candidate gene analysis with the goal of identifying the responsible modifier genes. In addition to the strain-dependent differences in clinical severity we also observed strain-dependent differences in hippocampal neuron sodium currents (INa). GABAergic interneurons isolated from the F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased INa density compared to wildtype littermate controls. In contrast INa density is preserved in GABAergic interneurons isolated from 129.Scn1a+/- and is no different from wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for the loss of Nav1.1 while F1 interneurons do not. Based on this observation we hypothesize that there are strain differences in compensatory capacity in the context of Scn1a heterozygous deletion. We propose to perform RNA-seq analysis to characterize hippocampal transcriptome differences during the critical phase of phenotype onset in susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant 129.Scn1a+/- mice. The results of this analysis will suggest candidate modifier genes and pathways that influence phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Identification of Dravet syndrome modifier genes will provide insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and will suggest novel therapeutic strategies for the improved treatment of human patients.,337969

The childhood epileptic encephalopathies (CEE) are the most severe types of epilepsy characterized by refractory seizures cognitive arrest or regression associated with ongoing epileptic activity and a poor prognosis. Identifying the genetic causes of CEE is the initial step toward developing more effective diagnostic tests prognosis counseling and treatments. Despite significant advances in gene discovery in recent years the majority of patient with CEE remain undiagnosed. Our recent work (R01NS069605) to investigate the genetic basis of epilepsy helped establish the role of copy number variants (CNVs) in CEE. More recently we use a high-throughput targeted sequencing strategy to screen 73 known and candidate CEE genes for mutations in a cohort of >500 CEE probands identifying pathogenic mutations in >10% of patients. Our studies identified CHD2 and SYNGAP1 as novel and important causes of CEE GRIN2A as a cause of epilepsy-aphasia syndromes and GABRA1 and STXBP1 as causes of a subset of SCN1A- negative Dravet syndrome. In this proposal we build upon these successes and propose three lines of investigation. First we will use trio exome sequencing in 150 patients with CEE who have already been screened for mutations in a large number of CEE genes and are therefore enriched for gene discovery. Second we will use high-throughput targeted of a panel of CEE and ID genes to investigate the role of these genes in several related neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Finally we will investigate the role of the chromatin remodeling pathway in epileptogenesis highlighted by the discovery of CHD2 mutations in a subset of CEE patients. Successful completion of our aims will lead to improved genetic diagnosis of patients better prognosis and recurrence risk counseling for families and novel targets for development of therapeutics.,619730

The multiplicity of causes of the disease poses an obvious challenge to the development of a general therapeutic approach. Even when epilepsy is caused by a single gene alteration such as in Dravet syndrome in humans the changes in the activity of the affected neurons can be too severe to be successfully targeted by the existing drugs. Our findings revealed a novel signaling control mechanism that has a major potential for the treatment of epilepsy.

We found that a neuron-enriched microRNA miR-128 acts as a negative master modulator of neuronal signaling responses in mice. The importance of the miR-128 in brain function is underscored by the development of fatal epileptic seizures in mice that lack miR-128 in postnatal forebrain neurons. Accordingly overexpression of miR-128 in neurons attenuates chemically-induced seizures and rescues survival in mice. These findings reveal miR-128 as a previously unknown key regulator of neuronal activity with a potential for the development of novel anti-epileptic therapeutic approaches. The major regulatory function of miR-128 highlights the importance of the mechanisms that control miR-128 expression levels as well as miR-128 access to its targets in neurons. We found that calcineurin/NFAT activity an important signaling pathway in neuronal development and function controls miR-128 expression in neurons. Most importantly mice with neuronal calcineurin deficiency develop a fatal seizure syndrome similar to the one observed in mice with miR-128 deficiency. These findings provided a strong indication for the role of calcineurin/NFAT signaling in control of miR-128 expression. The mechanism of calcineurin/NFAT-mediated regulation of miR-128 expression will be addressed in this proposal. The proposal also addresses a novel mechanism of regulation of miR-128 effector function. Preliminary data suggest that access of miR-128 to its mRNA targets is regulated by miR-128-sequestring non-coding decoy RNAs. This novel mechanism of regulation of miR-128 effector function will be explored in experiments using unique mouse models with inactivation or overexpression of the neuron-specific miR-128 decoy RNAs in combination with the molecular electrophysiological and behavioral approaches that have been established in our laboratory. The central role of miR-128 in neuronal signaling makes this miRNA an attractive target for potential therapeutic intervention of epilepsy. Using a mouse model of the human Dravet syndrome one the most severe and often treatment resistant forms of epilepsy the proposal will explore the therapeutic potential of neuronal miR-128 modulation for the treatment of the disease. To bring the research closer to the development of actual antiepileptic therapy we will explore the antiepileptic potential of exogenously expressed miR-128. MiR-128 will be delivered to defined neurons using neurotrophic adeno-associated viruses (AAV) that are currently considered as the most reliable vehicle for in vivo gene delivery in mice and human. In summary our proposal describes highly innovative and hypothesis driven studies of a novel non-coding RNA mechanism for controlling neuronal signaling and activity that has a strong potential to be applied for the treatment of human epilepsy.   ",369434

Within these genetic epilepsies there is variable penetrance and expressivity of the clinical phenotype suggesting a role for genetic modifiers. We have developed mouse models with mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels and seizure-related phenotypes with different underlying mechanisms. Scn2aQ54 transgenic mice have a gain-of-function mutation that results in spontaneous adult-onset partial motor seizures and models features of GEFS+. Heterozygous Scn1a+/- null mice are a model of Dravet Syndrome a severe infant-onset epilepsy with progressive worsening accompanied by psychomotor regression. A common feature of these mouse models is that epilepsy severity varies depending on the genetic strain background suggesting that genetic modifiers influence the phenotype. Scn2aQ54 mice on the resistant C57BL/6J background have delayed onset decreased severity and improved survival compared to the susceptible (C57BL/6J x SJL/J)F1 background. Conversely the epilepsy phenotype of Scn1a+/- mice is more severe on the C57BL/6J background while they have delayed onset and improved survival on the 129S6/SvEvTac strain background. Based on these observations we hypothesize that multiple genetic modifiers act to influence penetrance and expressivity of the primary epilepsy mutation. Previously we mapped two modifier loci that are responsible for the strain difference in Scn2aQ54 mice: Moe1 (modifier of epilepsy 1) on Chromosome 11 and Moe2 on Chromosome 19. During the previous funding period we performed fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of the Moe1 region identified the Moe2 modifier gene and identified additional modifier loci that influence the Scn2aQ54 phenotype. We propose to continue our analysis of epilepsy modifiers using the Scn2aQ54 and Scn1a+/- mouse models. First we will identify the responsible genes at Scn2aQ54 modifier loci. Next we will determine the molecular basis of the Moe2 modifier effect. Finally we will map genetic modifier loci in the Scn1a+/- mouse model and perform transcriptome analysis via RNA-seq for accelerated identification of candidate genes. The major goal of our studies is to identify and characterize modifier genes that influence epilepsy susceptibility and severity.

The neural bases for sleep disorders in DS are unknown in part because until recently there were no animal models for this disease. The main goal of this grant is to study the mechanisms underlying these sleep disorders using a recently developed mouse model of DS.            ",NINDS,9004847,8/18/2015 0:00,PA-13-302,1R01NS094211-01,1,R01,NS,94211,1, ,"HE, JANET",9/1/2015 0:00,8/31/2019 0:00,"Neuroendocrinology, Neuroimmunology, Rhythms and Sleep Study Section[NNRS]", ,8146532,"DE LA IGLESIA, HORACIO O",Not Applicable,7,BIOLOGY,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2015 0:00,8/31/2016 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2015,337969, ,NINDS,218750,119219, ,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Animals carrying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the Scn1a gene (Scn1a+/- mice) which encodes a subunit of the voltage-gated Na+ channel NaV1.1 show deficits in both homeostatic regulation of sleep and circadian regulation of rest-activity cycles. The NaV1.1 channel is the primary voltage-gated Na+ channel in adult GABAergic interneurons and its reduced activity results in a decrease of GABAergic tone suggesting that sleep regulatory deficits in Scn1a+/- mice emerge from reduced GABAergic activity. However Scn1a+/- mice are a model of a severe form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome (DS) and as DS patients show not only dysregulation of sleep but also generalized seizures. Epileptic activity complicates the interpretation of sleep disorders in DS as sleep regulatory deficits could be the result of sleep disruption by seizures or of seizure-associated neural damage. Our hypothesis is that sleep disorders in DS are the consequence of reduced GABAergic tone within sleep regulatory centers that is independent of the presence of seizures. To address this hypothesis we propose to conditionally target the Scn1a+/- mutation to specific neurons and brain regions. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether sleep abnormalities in global Scn1a+/- mice emerge from the effect of the mutation specifically on GABAergic neurons. We will target the Scn1a+/- mutation to these cells using an Scn1alox/- mouse and a Cre driver mouse line that targets GABAergic neurons throughout the brain and will assess the integrity of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep in these mutants. This approach will unequivocally determine whether sleep regulatory deficits in Scn1a+/- mice are the result of reduced NaV1.1 channel activity within GABAergic cells or whether non- GABAergic cells that express the channel also contribute to this phenotype. Specific Aim 2 will target the Scn1a+/- mutation to cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) the site of the central circadian pacemaker that regulates sleep. Viruses expressing Cre recombinase targeting either all SCN cells or specifically vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-containing cells will be injected wihin the SCN of Scn1alox/+ mice. We will also target the mutation to the SCN VIPergic cells by crossing Scn1alox/+ mice with a mouse line in which the VIP promoter drives the expression of Cre. Because VIP neurons are essential for the integrity of the SCN oscillatory network we expect that these VIP-specific Scn1a+/- mutants will show similar effects to mutants in which all SCN cells are targeted. Specific Aim 3 will virally target the Scn1a+/- mutation to the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RNT) which is essential for the generation of slow-wave sleep and spindles during non- REM sleep both compromised in Scn1a+/- mice. None of the conditional mutant approaches in Aims 1 and 2 is expected to induce seizures offering a unique opportunity to assess the effect of reduced NaV1.1 channel activity in sleep regulatory regions in the absence of seizures. We predict that the conditional targeting of the Scn1a+/- mutation to the SCN and RNT will lead to deficits in circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep respectively. These results would provide direct support for the role of the NaV1.1 channel within these brain regions in the regulation of sleep. They would also directly support our hypothesis that both circadian and homeostatic sleep deficits in DS emerge from seizure-independent reduced GABAergic activity in specific brain regions providing new avenues for the treatment of sleep disorders in DS.      ",337969

Although it is assumed that developmental seizures are at the origin of the cognitiveimpairment we defend the hypothesis that the sodium channel mutation identified in thissyndrome is also directly affecting neural processing and therefore cognition.

SCN1A mutations have also been describedin autism and reduced levels of Nav1.1 are observed in various models of Alzheimer disease (AD). Nav1.1 ishighly expressed in inhibitory interneurons that as we defend here not only explains seizures but alsocognitive impairments. Interneurons play a critical role in information processing by controlling the timing ofaction potentials and oscillatory activities. Alterations of such fundamental components of the neuronal circuitryare likely to have profound consequences on neural processing and therefore cognition.The goal of this proposal is to investigate the physiological mechanisms leading to cognitive impairments anddetermine if there is a critical period of development where cognitive systems are permanently sensitive to themutation effects. To approach this question we have developed a technique to transiently suppress Nav1.1expression using RNA interference in rats. This procedure induced cognitive impairments without seizures inrats and can be targeted at specific structures and initiated at specific developmental periods. We hypothesizethat NaV1.1 deficits will be sufficient to affect neuronal coding oscillatory activity and cognition. Wealso hypothesize that there is a critical period during which cognitive development is particularlysensitive to NaV1.1 abnormalities.To test these hypotheses we will combine in vivo RNA interference dynamic analysis of electro-encephalographic (EEG) oscillations and single cell electrophysiology (place cells) in rats performing memorytasks. The first part of this project will be to determine if there is a critical period during which NaV1.1 is criticalfor cognitive development. We will investigate the acute and long-term cognitive outcomes of intraventricularsiRNA administration performed at different periods of post-natal development. In the second aim investigatesthe neural mechanisms by which NaV1.1 reduction induces cognitive impairments. Here injections will befocused on a specific structure the septo-hippocampal region which is the neural substrate of spatial memoryin rats. The role of interneurons in the physiological properties of this network is well characterized making thisan ideal network to investigate.The possibility that cognitive impairments may be caused by abnormal neuronal processing in addition toseizures would constitute a paradigm shift in the approach to DS and other childhood epilepsy disorders withpoor cognitive outcome. It would suggest that additional treatment strategies focusing on cognitive functionother than traditional antiepileptic drugs may be necessary to recover normal cognitive function in affectedchildren.,333594

These include Dravet Syndrome (DS) and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Both DS and GEFS+ are autosomal dominant disorders but relatively little is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying seizure generation. Here we propose to assess the functional consequences of disease causing mutations on neuronal activity using two complementary genetic model systems: knock-in Drosophila with SCN1A mutations and iPSC-derived neurons from patients with the same mutations. Our preliminary data demonstrate that knock-in of a GEFS+ SCN1A mutation (K1270T) into the Drosophila sodium channel gene para causes a semi-dominant temperature-induced seizure phenotype. Electrophysiological studies of GABAergic interneurons in the brains of adult GEFS+ flies reveal a novel cellular mechanism underlying heat-induced seizure. Consistent with disease symptoms in humans the seizure phenotype caused by knock-in of a DS mutation (S1231R) is more severe than GEFS+. The congruence of the genotype-to-phenotype map between flies and human in this genetic disease model paves the way for use of knock-in Drosophila to study the mechanisms underlying these complex human genetic disorders. The first two aims are focused on use of Drosophila sodium channel knock-in lines to further explore the underlying cellular mechanisms contributing to heat-induced seizures and as a low cost high efficiency platform for discovery of genetic modifiers and drugs that suppress the seizure phenotype. In specific Aim 3 we will employ our expertise in stem cell biology to conduct parallel studies of neuronal activity in iPSC-derived neurons from patients with the same GEFS+ mutations examined in knock-in flies. Identification of common cellular mechanisms in these two model systems has the potential to identify targets for development of novel therapies to reduce or eliminate seizures in humans with epilepsy.,526152

Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have treatment resistant (refractory) seizures thereby presenting a major clinical challenge and burden. The most common form of refractory epilepsy is mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) characterized by spontaneous seizures neuropsychological deficits and hippocampal sclerosis. At present surgical resection of the epilepsy focus is the best treatment strategy for this disorder; however this procedure is only used in a subset of cases. Consequently there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatments.  Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) SCN1A SCN2A and SCN3A are associated with several epilepsy subtypes including Dravet syndrome (DS) and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Gain of function mutations in the VGSC SCN8A have recently identified in individuals with epileptic encephalopathies. However our laboratory has demonstrated that mice with Scn8a mutations that reduce channel activity or expression are more resistant to induced seizures when compared to their wild-type littermates. In addition we were able to dramatically ameliorate seizure severity and restore normal lifespans to Scn1a mutants that model DS and GEFS+ by either co-segregation of an Scn8a mutation or hippocampal knockdown of Scn8a expression. Since the hippocampus is the major site of seizure generation and morphological changes in MTLE we hypothesize that selective reduction of SCN8A expression in the hippocampus will provide an effective strategy for the treatment of MTLE. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will establish the effect on spontaneous seizure frequency and severity of reducing hippocampal Scn8a expression in the widely used intra-hippocampal kainic acid mouse model of MTLE. Reduced Scn8a expression will be achieved by hippocampal injection of an adeno-associated viral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA against Scn8a (AAV-3). Seizure activity will be monitored in AAV-3 treated mice using continuous video/EEG analysis and will be compared to control mice injected with a scrambled construct (AAV-GFP). In Aim 2 we will determine if hippocampal reduction of Scn8a expression could also prevent or ameliorate the changes in behavior and hippocampal morphology and that are observed in this model of MTLE. Finally in Aim 3 we compare the biophysical properties of hippocampal slices from the AAV-3 and AAV-GFP treated mice in order to directly examine neuronal excitability. We will also test if partial pharmacological block of Nav1.6 using novel compounds can reduce seizure-like bursting activity in hippocampal slices from the MTLE mouse model and we will explore the contribution of the different VGSCs to the development of MTLE. This clinically relevant proposal will provide important insight into the feasibility of targeting SCN8A as a treatment for MTLE and more broadly for other forms of refractory epilepsy.      ",479441

Within these genetic epilepsies there is variable penetrance and expressivity of the clinical phenotype suggesting a role for genetic modifiers. We have developed mouse models with mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels and seizure-related phenotypes with different underlying mechanisms. Scn2aQ54 transgenic mice have a gain-of-function mutation that results in spontaneous adult-onset partial motor seizures and models features of GEFS+. Heterozygous Scn1a+/- null mice are a model of Dravet Syndrome a severe infant-onset epilepsy with progressive worsening accompanied by psychomotor regression. A common feature of these mouse models is that epilepsy severity varies depending on the genetic strain background suggesting that genetic modifiers influence the phenotype. Scn2aQ54 mice on the resistant C57BL/6J background have delayed onset decreased severity and improved survival compared to the susceptible (C57BL/6J x SJL/J)F1 background. Conversely the epilepsy phenotype of Scn1a+/- mice is more severe on the C57BL/6J background while they have delayed onset and improved survival on the 129S6/SvEvTac strain background. Based on these observations we hypothesize that multiple genetic modifiers act to influence penetrance and expressivity of the primary epilepsy mutation. Previously we mapped two modifier loci that are responsible for the strain difference in Scn2aQ54 mice: Moe1 (modifier of epilepsy 1) on Chromosome 11 and Moe2 on Chromosome 19. During the previous funding period we performed fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of the Moe1 region identified the Moe2 modifier gene and identified additional modifier loci that influence the Scn2aQ54 phenotype. We propose to continue our analysis of epilepsy modifiers using the Scn2aQ54 and Scn1a+/- mouse models. First we will identify the responsible genes at Scn2aQ54 modifier loci. Next we will determine the molecular basis of the Moe2 modifier effect. Finally we will map genetic modifier loci in the Scn1a+/- mouse model and perform transcriptome analysis via RNA-seq for accelerated identification of candidate genes. The major goal of our studies is to identify and characterize modifier genes that influence epilepsy susceptibility and severity. These genes are likely to contribute to common epilepsy syndromes with more complex genetics. Identification of epilepsy modifier genes will provide insight into the basic biology of epileptogenesis and may identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of human patients.,337969

There is a surprisingly common lack of awareness among patients and physicians of this increased risk of sudden death. In a recent survey only 56% of Canadian pediatricians who treat patients with epilepsy knew their patients were at increased risk for sudden death and only 33% of these physicians knew the term SUDEP. There is controversy regarding whether cardiac failure or respiratory arrest is more important as the primary cause of death but cardiac and respiratory data is rarely collected simultaneously from human cases of SUDEP or from mouse models. For example in the more than 20 documented cases of SUDEP that occurred while the patient was undergoing EMU monitoring none of these patients had measurements of ventilation or even blood oxygenation. Effective preventive strategies in high-risk epileptic patients will rely on defining the mechanisms that lead from seizures to death. Our preliminary data suggest that respiratory depression is the primary cause of death in some cases of SUDEP and that patients with Dravet syndrome have previously uncharacterized breathing abnormalities in the peri-ictal period. Furthermore our data has indicated there is an anatomical pathway that inhibits ventilation which extends from the amygdala and anterior temporal lobe to medullary nuclei that control breathing. However it is unclear how this circuit is connected and the identities of the neurons involved. In Aim 1 we will characterize peri-ictal cardiorespiratory control in human patients with Dravet syndrome as well as mouse models of this pathology. In Aim 2 we will define the anatomical pathway from the amygdala to the brainstem that inhibits the cardiovascular and respiratory control networks during seizures. Finally in Aim 3 we will determine the identity of brainstem neurons that receive inputs from the amygdala and inhibit breathing and consciousness during seizures. This work will identify an anatomical pathway by which cortical seizures can invade the midbrain and brainstem and cause depressed cardiorespiratory function and arousal. Our findings have the potential to characterize key components of this circuit and may identify biomarkers that can be used to develop effective screening strategies. Better understanding mechanisms that underlie SUDEP will allow future development of preventative treatments that may decrease SUDEP risk.,627339

Until now there has not been an organized clinical network specifically focused on individuals at high risk for SUDEP. Moreover there is a lack of unified clinical monitoring algorithms that will stratify SUDEP risk i patient population allow in-depth correlative analysis with brain morphometric studies and genetic investigations and inform model systems of premature epilepsy mortality. We therefore propose a Clinical Network Core (SRA-CNC) that consists of four principal components: (1) a Pediatric Clinical Network (PCN) aimed at recruitment physiological monitoring and sample collection in children affected by Dravet syndrome (2) an Adult Clinical Network (ACN) focused on high SUDEP risk adult patients based on the combined phenotype of epilepsy cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory dysfunction (3) Analysis Center entails physiological morphometric and epidemiological evaluations of the human data and (4) Data integration and storage. The SRA-CNC will perform four main functions; (1) It will establish infrastructure logistical and regulatory support and implement standard operating procedures for case ascertainment scope and mode of physiological monitoring and data collection and procurement of biological specimens; (2) it will provide problem focused expert analysis of the (i) clinical and epidemiological data (ii) ictal cardiac and respiratory physiology and (iii) imaging based morphometry; (3) It will optimize resource utilization and facilitate data exchange analysis and communication among participating centers; and (4) SRA-CNC will translate investigational procedures into clinical practice in the form of public education and evidence driven recommendations. The Clinical Network Core is an essential component of the proposed SUDEP Center Without Wall piloted by the investigators of SUDEP Research Alliance as it will inform and facilitate current and future research translational projects in humans and i the individualized model systems.,165805

Although SUDEP is the most devastating consequence of epilepsy and the leading cause of epilepsy mortality astonishingly little is understood about its causes and no biomarkers exist to identify at risk epilepsy patients. To advance our understanding of these critical issues we will focus on Dravet Syndrome (DS) a severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy associated with a high SUDEP incidence. DS is most frequently caused by mutations in the voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) gene SCN1A encoding NaV1.1. As NaV1.1 is expressed in brain heart and peripheral nerves a compelling idea is that altered Na+ currents (INa) in DS cardiac myocytes (CMs) or autonomic neurons in addition to central neurons lead to arrhythmias and SUDEP. We used the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) method to derive central and peripheral neurons and CMs from fibroblasts of DS subjects. Preliminary data from DS patient CMs suggest that a subset of DS subjects shows abnormal CM INa and excitability. In studies of a DS human mutant SCN1A knock-in mouse model we observed spontaneous seizures and SUDEP increased ventricular CM INa density and ventricular arrhythmias at the time of SUDEP. Similarly we found increased ventricular CM INa density spontaneous seizures and SUDEP in a Scn1b null DS mouse model. Our work studies of Scn1a heterozygous null DS mice and clinical ECG studies in DS also show altered cardiac autonomic function. Thus we hypothesize that SUDEP in DS is caused by VGSC mutations that produce cardiac electrical and/or autonomic dysfunction in addition to brain dysfunction. Furthermore that combined insights from studies of DS patient-derived cells mouse models and patient peri-ictal ECG data will yield biomarkers of SUDEP risk in DS.  Four specific aims will test these hypotheses: 1) To understand the effects of DS-linked SCN1A mutations on cardiac excitability using DS patient iPSC-derived CMs and DS mice; 2) To determine how DS-linked SCN1A mutations influence the excitability of autonomic neurons cardiac autonomic innervation and autonomic control of cardiac function using DS patient iPSC-derived autonomic neurons and DS mice; 3) To investigate changes in autonomic excitability in a second mouse model of DS Scn1b null mice and in SCN1B-DS patient iPSC CMs and neurons; and 4) To determine whether cardiac electrical and/or autonomic function is altered in DS patients at baseline or peri-ictally. Our wor will synergize with the entire CWOW proposal to not only uncover SUDEP mechanisms in DS but also to provide advances in understanding SUDEP causes and biomarkers that will be applicable to other refractory epilepsies due to ion channelopathies and perhaps other etiologies. This work will also show proof-of-principle for the use of multiple platforms (cellularand clinical data from the same patients and multiple mouse models) to individualize SUDEP risk and develop patient-specific preventative treatments.",659075

The most catastrophic of these is Dravet Syndrome (DS)/Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy of Infancy (SMEI) which often does not respond to currently available anti-seizure drugs. Along with severe seizures children with DS/SMEI have developmental and learning difficulties and increased risk for epilepsy-related death. Thus there is a significant and urgent need for the development of new approaches to therapies to treat this family of epilepsies.

In the most severe cases progressive developmental and behavioral impairments manifest along with the recurrent and varied seizure episodes that advance to include multiple seizure types by age 2. In many patients seizures are resistant to currently available antiepileptic drugs. Thus there is a significant and urgent need for the development of novel approaches to therapy. SCN1 channel function in inhibition is functionally opposed by the related SCN8 channel. Thus a validated and logical strategy for rebalancing the deficit of inhibitory input caused by SCN1A loss-of-function mutation is to specifically reduce SCN8-mediated excitation.  VGS channel alpha subunits undergo several alternative splicing events which regulate the inhibitory and excitatory balance of sodium currents in the CNS. SCN8A subunits are naturally alternatively spliced at two specific sites of interest which control channe function or kinetics. A novel strategy to reduce SCN8A- mediated excitation and seizures associated with SCN1A loss-of-function mutations as a treatment for DS is to direct splicing at each of these sites by developing compounds called splice modulating oligonucleotides (SMOs). SMOs are a class of synthetic RNA based compounds that sterically block or weaken interactions between elements of the splice machinery and the pre-mRNA. SMOs are ideal but under-developed drug candidates as they bind to their targets with exceptional potency specificity and negligible off-target effects.  SMOs targeting SCN8A splicing will designed in silico and refined for potency and specificity in vivo (Aim 1) leading to an SMO drug candidate for each splice site. Each SMO candidate will be characterized by dose-response in normal mice at P10-42 days and SMO dose-effect on flurothyl-induced seizure threshold evaluated in normal mice (Aim 2). Finally SMOs will be evaluated as therapeutics in SNN1A R1648H mutant mice (Aim 3) for effects on longevity motor function (ataxia tremor) and flurothyl-induced seizure susceptibility. Safety and efficacy of SMO treatment will further be assessed for both positive and adverse effects on behavior in adult heterozygous SCN1A R1648H mice which have a normal lifespan. The strategy of specifically reducing only the Na+ channel (SCN8A) that counterbalances SCN1A input should be more efficacious and be much less likely to cause unwanted effects than using sodium channel blockers which antagonize multiple VGS channels. The ultimate goal is to develop these SMOs as potential therapeutic for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome and related disorders in patients resistant to currently available pharmacotherapies.,345200

A variety of inherited disorders affecting skeletal muscle contraction (hyperkalemic periodic paralysis paramyotonia congenita K+-aggravated myotonia) cardiac excitability (congenital long QT syndrome idiopathic ventricular fibrillation familial conduction system disease) and certain forms of epilepsy have been associated with mutations in human NaV channel genes. This proposal is a competing renewal of R01-NS32387 that for 17 years has funded our efforts to elucidate the molecular genetic pathophysiologic and pharmacologic mechanisms of human sodium ""channelopathies"". We propose to continue our highly successful research program with a focus on epilepsies associated with mutant brain NaV channels. In Specific Aim 1 we will elucidate the functional consequences of novel epilepsy-associated SCN1A (encoding NaV1.1) mutations with a focus on two unstudied mechanistic aspects of mutant channel dysfunction. First we will investigate the functional consequences of a subset of mutations within a region of the NaV1.1 C-terminus having conserved Ca2+/calmodulin regulatory elements to test the hypothesis that these alleles affect channel function by altering the response of the channel to internal Ca2+ signaling. Second we will investigate whether alternative splicing influences the functional consequences of SCN1A mutations associated with divergent clinical phenotypes. In Specific Aim 2 we will elucidate the neurophysiological basis for strain- dependent epilepsy severity using two mechanistically distinct mouse models of epilepsy caused by mutant NaV channels: 1) transgenic mice expressing a gain-of-function Scn2a mutation (Q54 mice); and 2) heterozygous Scn1a knock out (Scn1a+/-) mice a model of human Dravet syndrome. Both models exhibit strong strain-dependence of epilepsy severity and impaired survival. Strain-dependence of murine phenotypes mimics the variable penetrance and disease expression characteristic of human monogenic epilepsies including those caused by mutant NaV channels. Ongoing efforts to map genomic loci responsible for this phenomenon have identified a new candidate gene for seizure susceptibility using Q54 mice. By integrating existing and future genomic data on modifiers of epilepsy with information about the neurophysiological correlates of phenotype strain-dependence we expect to generate important new insights into mechanisms responsible for the influence of genetic modifiers relevant to human idiopathic epilepsy and to identify molecular pathways that could be therapeutic targets.",337969

Over 800 mutations in SCN1A encoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 have been reported patients. SCN1A mutations are associated with epilepsy phenotypes on the genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) spectrum. The GEFS+ spectrum ranges from simple febrile seizures on the mild end of the spectrum to Dravet syndrome on the severe end. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A result in Dravet syndrome an infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by a variety of seizure types developmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variable expressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by genetic modifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) model a number of features of Dravet syndrome including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reduced sodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons which is predicted to increase excitability due to failure of inhibition. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is stronglydependent on strain background. Scn1a+/- mice on the resistant 129 strain background (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrast Scn1a+/- mice on a (129xB6)F1 strain background (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality with 50% dying by 1 month of age. Based on the strain- dependent difference in phenotype we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severity. We recently mapped several modifier loci that influence premature lethality of Scn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal we will perform fine mapping and candidate gene analysis with the goal of identifying the responsible modifier genes. In addition to the strain-dependent differences in clinical severity we also observed strain-dependent differences in hippocampal neuron sodium currents (INa). GABAergic interneurons isolated from the F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased INa density compared to wildtype littermate controls. In contrast INa density is preserved in GABAergic interneurons isolated from 129.Scn1a+/- and is no different from wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for the loss of Nav1.1 while F1 interneurons do not. Based on this observation we hypothesize that there are strain differences in compensatory capacity in the context of Scn1a heterozygous deletion. We propose to perform RNA-seq analysis to characterize hippocampal transcriptome differences during the critical phase of phenotype onset in susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant 129.Scn1a+/- mice.

We have developed a mouse genetic model with all the features of DS. This project will provide new insights into the mechanisms of pathophysiology of DS and will develop new therapeutic approaches to this disastrous childhood disease.                __SpecificAimsTextDelimiter__ Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a devastating childhood neuropsychiatric disorder caused by de novo heterozygousloss-of-function mutations in the brain type-I voltage-gated Na channel Nav1.11. Affected children developnormally for 6-9 months when repeated febrile seizures are followed by progression to severe spontaneousseizures and status epilepticus (SE). Co-morbidities of developmental delay and cognitive impairment appearwith age and teenage patients have IQ's of 50. Up to 15% of affected children die prematurely most oftenfrom Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). We have developed a mouse genetic model with all thefeatures of DS2. Mice become susceptible to thermal induction of seizures on postnatal day (P) 203 havespontaneous seizures on P2123 and develop ataxia4 circadian abnormalities5 sleep disorder6 cognitivedeficit7 autistic-like features7 and SUDEP28. All of these effects of DS are correlated with loss of Na currentsand excitability of specific classes of GABAergic interneurons without effects on excitatory neurons whichcauses imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neural circuits. Mutation of Nav1.1 channels specifically inforebrain GABAergic interneurons by the Cre-Lox method is sufficient to cause epilepsy premature deathcognitive impairment and autistic-like behaviors79 confirming that DS is caused by selective loss of Nav1.1channels in inhibitory neurons2. Remarkably cognitive deficit and autistic-like behaviors of DS mice can berescued by a single treatment with a low dose of the benzodiazepine GABA-A receptor co-activatorclonazepam (CLN) demonstrating that these life-changing co-morbidities are caused by the mutation ofNav1.1 channel itself rather than by neuronal damage from recurrent seizures7. Our Central Hypothesis is (i)epilepsy and co-morbidities in DS result from failure of excitability of GABAergic inhibitory neurons whichcreates an imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neural circuits and (ii) re-balancing excitation and inhibitionwith drug treatment will have therapeutic value for epilepsy SUDEP and co-morbidities in DS. To furtheradvance understanding of the cell biology pathophysiology and treatment of DS our Specific Aims are:1. Hyperexcitability of cells and circuits in DS mice. It is not known which classes of interneurons areinvolved in DS. Our results from brain slice recordings show decreased excitability of interneurons in thehippocampus and cerebral cortex. Fast-spiking inhibitory neurons have impaired excitability and Martinotti cellshave impaired disynaptic inhibition of pyramidal cells. We will use specific deletion of Nav1.1 channels indifferent classes of interneurons by the Cre-Lox method to determine which subtypes of interneuronscontribute to the failure of control of electrical excitability in DS mice. We will use localized microinjection andexpression of Cre from viral vectors to define the anatomical locations in which failure of expression of Nav1.1channels can lead to hyperexcitability and epilepsy. We will determine the physiological effects of these genedeletions using brain slice recording methods. We will use optogenetic methods to rescue excitability of therelevant GABAergic interneurons and thereby provide proof-of-concept for their role in DS. Our results will giveunique insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that lead to epilepsy and premature death in DS mice.2. Epileptogenesis in DS mice. Na currents are reduced at P14 in interneurons in DS mice but spontaneousseizures are first evident at P21 and reach peak at P25. In brain slices action potential generation ininterneurons is impaired at P21. We will use brain slice recording methods to document the changes inexcitability of cells and circuits in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex during this 12-day period ofepileptogenesis. In addition we will use immunocytochemical and mouse genetic approaches to identify thesites of hyperexcitability that appear first in DS mice in vivo and thereby determine the time course of changesin excitability of cells and circuits that lead to epilepsy. Imaging of Ca bound to CaM and parvalbumin (PV) willgive a visual record of increased excitability. In vivo labeling by induced activity-dependent expression offluorescently tagged Immediate Early Genes (IEG) in TRAP mice10 will give a high-resolution view ofdevelopment of hyperexcitability in defined time windows. Optogenetic-driven expression of Cre in relevantinterneurons will be used to interrupt the epileptogenesis process and provide proof-of-concept for the role ofspecific cell types in development of epilepsy.3. Status epilepticus in DS mice. Patients with DS have repetitive prolonged episodes of SE. We will induceSE by prolonged thermal induction of seizures in DS mice and determine the changes in excitability of cellsand circuits following one or more episodes of SE. We will assess cell injury by measurements of reactiveastrocytes neuroinflammation apoptosis and neuronal cell death.4. Novel therapeutics in DS mice. Our results indicate that novel rationally designed drug combinations areeffective in reducing seizures and premature death in DS mice with minimal side effects and that a single low-dose CLN treatment can rescue cognitive deficit and autistic-like behaviors. We will optimize combinationtherapy with CLN and other GABA-A receptor activators plus tiagabine in order to develop a therapeuticregime that prevents seizures premature death and cognitive impairment and minimizes tolerance duringchronic treatment. We will examine the effectiveness of new-generation subunit-selective GABA-A receptorco-activators. We will test the effectiveness of novel therapeutic approaches in control of SE in DS mice.,NINDS,8909201,8/12/2015 0:00,PA-11-260,5R01NS025704-27,5,R01,NS,25704,27, ,"SILBERBERG, SHAI D",2/1/1988 0:00,8/31/2016 0:00,Molecular Neurogenetics Study Section[MNG], ,1862697,"CATTERALL, WILLIAM A",Not Applicable,7,PHARMACOLOGY,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2015 0:00,8/31/2016 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2015,337969, ,NINDS,218750,119219, ,DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a devastating childhood neuropsychiatric disorder caused by de novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in brain type-I voltage-gated Na channel Nav1.1.

The childhood epileptic encephalopathies (CEE) are the most severe types of epilepsy characterized by refractory seizures cognitive arrest or regression associated with ongoing epileptic activity and a poor prognosis. Identifying the genetic causes of CEE is the initial step toward developing more effective diagnostic tests prognosis counseling and treatments. Despite significant advances in gene discovery in recent years the majority of patient with CEE remain undiagnosed. Our recent work (R01NS069605) to investigate the genetic basis of epilepsy helped establish the role of copy number variants (CNVs) in CEE. More recently we use a high-throughput targeted sequencing strategy to screen 73 known and candidate CEE genes for mutations in a cohort of >500 CEE probands identifying pathogenic mutations in >10% of patients. Our studies identified CHD2 and SYNGAP1 as novel and important causes of CEE GRIN2A as a cause of epilepsy-aphasia syndromes and GABRA1 and STXBP1 as causes of a subset of SCN1A- negative Dravet syndrome. In this proposal we build upon these successes and propose three lines of investigation. First we will use trio exome sequencing in 150 patients with CEE who have already been screened for mutations in a large number of CEE genes and are therefore enriched for gene discovery. Second we will use high-throughput targeted of a panel of CEE and ID genes to investigate the role of these genes in several related neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Finally we will investigate the role of the chromatin remodeling pathway in epileptogenesis highlighted by the discovery of CHD2 mutations in a subset of CEE patients. Successful completion of our aims will lead to improved genetic diagnosis of patients better prognosis and recurrence risk counseling for families and novel targets for development of therapeutics.      ",490653

Most such epilepsy syndromes are rather benign and are outgrown as patient age. However truncation mutations in the GABAA receptor gamma2 subunit gene GABRgamma2 are often but not always associated with a more severe phenotype Dravet syndrome (DS). To date most DS patients are associated with SCN1A loss of function mutations that result in impaired GABAergic interneuron activity and action potential firing. Synaptic GABAA receptors mediate inhibitory GABAergic transmission and characterizations of DS mouse model harboring GABRgamma2 (Q351X) mutation would provide new insights into the pathogenesis of DS as well as epilepsy in general. Combination of understandings from both SCN1A and GABRgamma2 mouse models will help pinpoint the final common pathophysiologic pathway on which two distinct groups of mutations converge. GABRgamma2 (Q351X) mutation is associated with two DS pedigrees. The heterozygous GABRgamma2 (Q351X) knockin (KI) mice which are patient condition recapitulate the major features of DS. The mice displayed multiple neurodevelopmental abnormalities and multiple forms of epilepsy including generalized tonic clonic epilepsy suggesting impaired synapse formation and function. Since simple GABRgamma2 gene knockout (KO) heterozygous mice do not have seizures this suggests that presence of the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunit protein and its related pathology contribute to the severe DS phenotype. We have previously demonstrated that the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunits were loss of function. Additionally the mutant protein accumulated intracellularly formed aggregates and imposed a dominant-negative effect on the wildtype subunits. The mutant aggregates were identified by mass spectrometry and the components of the aggregates were similar to those identified in inclusions found in neurodegenerative diseases such as the Lewy bodies characteristic of Parkinson's disease. Our pilot data demonstrated that the mutant protein also formed substantial aggregates in the heterozygous KI mice. The mutant subunits impaired GABAergic synaptogenesis and GABAergic transmission. The single quantum dot imaging indicated the synapse vs. extrasynapse distribution of GABAA receptors were altered in the mutant KI mice. We hypothesize that the accumulation and aggregation of the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunits impair synapse development and GABAergic transmission thus resulting in the severe phenotype as DS. In this proposal we will characterize in detail the mutant subunit accumulation aggregation and its impact on synapse formation stabilization connectivity and transmission. We will also characterize adaptive changes of wildtype GABAA receptor expression distribution mobility and turnover as well as neurobehaviors in the mutant GABRG2 (Q351X) heterozygous KI mice. We found overexpression of heat shock protein (Hsp)70 and Hsp40 reduced the total mutant and aggregated gamma2 subunit protein. We thus propose to test a novel therapeutic strategy by upregulating chaperones like Hsp70 and Hsp40 in the mutant KI mice.,341250

In the most severe cases progressive developmental and behavioral impairments manifest along with the recurrent and varied seizure episodes that advance to include multiple seizure types by age 2. In many patients seizures are resistant to currently available antiepileptic drugs. Thus there is a significant and urgent need for the development of novel approaches to therapy. SCN1 channel function in inhibition is functionally opposed by the related SCN8 channel. Thus a validated and logical strategy for rebalancing the deficit of inhibitory input caused by SCN1A loss-of-function mutation is to specifically reduce SCN8-mediated excitation.  VGS channel alpha subunits undergo several alternative splicing events which regulate the inhibitory and excitatory balance of sodium currents in the CNS. SCN8A subunits are naturally alternatively spliced at two specific sites of interest which control channe function or kinetics. A novel strategy to reduce SCN8A- mediated excitation and seizures associated with SCN1A loss-of-function mutations as a treatment for DS is to direct splicing at each of these sites by developing compounds called splice modulating oligonucleotides (SMOs). SMOs are a class of synthetic RNA based compounds that sterically block or weaken interactions between elements of the splice machinery and the pre-mRNA. SMOs are ideal but under-developed drug candidates as they bind to their targets with exceptional potency specificity and negligible off-target effects.  SMOs targeting SCN8A splicing will designed in silico and refined for potency and specificity in vivo (Aim 1) leading to an SMO drug candidate for each splice site. Each SMO candidate will be characterized by dose-response in normal mice at P10-42 days and SMO dose-effect on flurothyl-induced seizure threshold evaluated in normal mice (Aim 2). Finally SMOs will be evaluated as therapeutics in SNN1A R1648H mutant mice (Aim 3) for effects on longevity motor function (ataxia tremor) and flurothyl-induced seizure susceptibility. Safety and efficacy of SMO treatment will further be assessed for both positive and adverse effects on behavior in adult heterozygous SCN1A R1648H mice which have a normal lifespan. The strategy of specifically reducing only the Na+ channel (SCN8A) that counterbalances SCN1A input should be more efficacious and be much less likely to cause unwanted effects than using sodium channel blockers which antagonize multiple VGS channels. The ultimate goal is to develop these SMOs as potential therapeutic for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome and related disorders in patients resistant to currently available pharmacotherapies.      ",342600

There is a surprisingly common lack of awareness among patients and physicians of this increased risk of sudden death. In a recent survey only 56% of Canadian pediatricians who treat patients with epilepsy knew their patients were at increased risk for sudden death and only 33% of these physicians knew the term SUDEP. There is controversy regarding whether cardiac failure or respiratory arrest is more important as the primary cause of death but cardiac and respiratory data is rarely collected simultaneously from human cases of SUDEP or from mouse models. For example in the more than 20 documented cases of SUDEP that occurred while the patient was undergoing EMU monitoring none of these patients had measurements of ventilation or even blood oxygenation. Effective preventive strategies in high-risk epileptic patients will rely on defining the mechanisms that lead from seizures to death. Our preliminary data suggest that respiratory depression is the primary cause of death in some cases of SUDEP and that patients with Dravet syndrome have previously uncharacterized breathing abnormalities in the peri-ictal period. Furthermore our data has indicated there is an anatomical pathway that inhibits ventilation which extends from the amygdala and anterior temporal lobe to medullary nuclei that control breathing. However it is unclear how this circuit is connected and the identities of the neurons involved. In Aim 1 we will characterize peri-ictal cardiorespiratory control in human patients with Dravet syndrome as well as mouse models of this pathology. In Aim 2 we will define the anatomical pathway from the amygdala to the brainstem that inhibits the cardiovascular and respiratory control networks during seizures. Finally in Aim 3 we will determine the identity of brainstem neurons that receive inputs from the amygdala and inhibit breathing and consciousness during seizures. This work will identify an anatomical pathway by which cortical seizures can invade the midbrain and brainstem and cause depressed cardiorespiratory function and arousal.

Although SUDEP is the most devastating consequence of epilepsy and the leading cause of epilepsy mortality astonishingly little is understood about its causes and no biomarkers exist to identify at risk epilepsy patients. To advance our understanding of these critical issues we will focus on Dravet Syndrome (DS) a severe childhood epileptic encephalopathy associated with a high SUDEP incidence. DS is most frequently caused by mutations in the voltage-gated Na+ channel (VGSC) gene SCN1A encoding NaV1.1. As NaV1.1 is expressed in brain heart and peripheral nerves a compelling idea is that altered Na+ currents (INa) in DS cardiac myocytes (CMs) or autonomic neurons in addition to central neurons lead to arrhythmias and SUDEP. We used the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) method to derive central and peripheral neurons and CMs from fibroblasts of DS subjects. Preliminary data from DS patient CMs suggest that a subset of DS subjects shows abnormal CM INa and excitability. In studies of a DS human mutant SCN1A knock-in mouse model we observed spontaneous seizures and SUDEP increased ventricular CM INa density and ventricular arrhythmias at the time of SUDEP. Similarly we found increased ventricular CM INa density spontaneous seizures and SUDEP in a Scn1b null DS mouse model. Our work studies of Scn1a heterozygous null DS mice and clinical ECG studies in DS also show altered cardiac autonomic function. Thus we hypothesize that SUDEP in DS is caused by VGSC mutations that produce cardiac electrical and/or autonomic dysfunction in addition to brain dysfunction. Furthermore that combined insights from studies of DS patient-derived cells mouse models and patient peri-ictal ECG data will yield biomarkers of SUDEP risk in DS.  Four specific aims will test these hypotheses: 1) To understand the effects of DS-linked SCN1A mutations on cardiac excitability using DS patient iPSC-derived CMs and DS mice; 2) To determine how DS-linked SCN1A mutations influence the excitability of autonomic neurons cardiac autonomic innervation and autonomic control of cardiac function using DS patient iPSC-derived autonomic neurons and DS mice; 3) To investigate changes in autonomic excitability in a second mouse model of DS Scn1b null mice and in SCN1B-DS patient iPSC CMs and neurons; and 4) To determine whether cardiac electrical and/or autonomic function is altered in DS patients at baseline or peri-ictally. Our wor will synergize with the entire CWOW proposal to not only uncover SUDEP mechanisms in DS but also to provide advances in understanding SUDEP causes and biomarkers that will be applicable to other refractory epilepsies due to ion channelopathies and perhaps other etiologies. This work will also show proof-of-principle for the use of multiple platforms (cellularand clinical data from the same patients and multiple mouse models) to individualize SUDEP risk and develop patient-specific preventative treatments.      ",657934

However numerous genetic models that mimic many features of human epilepsies have now been described. These models provide important information but are not easily adapted to drug discovery programs. As a simple vertebrate species amenable to rapid genetic manipulation and high-throughput drug screening we propose an alternative approach using mutant zebrafish (Danio rerio) with spontaneous recurrent seizure phenotypes (i.e. epilepsy) as a platform to identify new treatments for medically refractory epilepsy. We recently began to explore the possibility that spontaneous single-gene mutations in zebrafish - especially those mimicking catastrophic forms of epilepsy often seen in children - result in epileptic phenotypes. Zebrafish mutants featuring a loss-of-function sodium channel (Nav1.1/SCN1A) mutation (e.g. a gene family identified in children with Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy and Dravet syndrome) were recently identified by our laboratory as epileptic zebrafish with phenotypes similar to the human condition. Using large-scale transcriptome analysis automated behavioral tracking in vivo electrophysiology and pharmacological approaches we describe a novel approach to further our understanding and potential treatment of debilitating epilepsy disorders associated with Nav1.1 mutation. In this EUREKA proposal we will use these mutant zebrafish in our efforts to (i) identify molecular targets for therapeutic treatment of DS/SMEI and (ii) identify drug candidates for therapeutic treatment of DS/SMEI. Our results promise to establish an alternative zebrafish-based approach for high-throughput small-molecule drug discovery targeted to monogenic epilepsy disorders seen primarily in children.,309000

SCN1A mutations have also been describedin autism and reduced levels of Nav1.1 are observed in various models of Alzheimer disease (AD). Nav1.1 ishighly expressed in inhibitory interneurons that as we defend here not only explains seizures but alsocognitive impairments. Interneurons play a critical role in information processing by controlling the timing ofaction potentials and oscillatory activities. Alterations of such fundamental components of the neuronal circuitryare likely to have profound consequences on neural processing and therefore cognition.The goal of this proposal is to investigate the physiological mechanisms leading to cognitive impairments anddetermine if there is a critical period of development where cognitive systems are permanently sensitive to themutation effects. To approach this question we have developed a technique to transiently suppress Nav1.1expression using RNA interference in rats. This procedure induced cognitive impairments without seizures inrats and can be targeted at specific structures and initiated at specific developmental periods. We hypothesizethat NaV1.1 deficits will be sufficient to affect neuronal coding oscillatory activity and cognition. Wealso hypothesize that there is a critical period during which cognitive development is particularlysensitive to NaV1.1 abnormalities.To test these hypotheses we will combine in vivo RNA interference dynamic analysis of electro-encephalographic (EEG) oscillations and single cell electrophysiology (place cells) in rats performing memorytasks. The first part of this project will be to determine if there is a critical period during which NaV1.1 is criticalfor cognitive development. We will investigate the acute and long-term cognitive outcomes of intraventricularsiRNA administration performed at different periods of post-natal development. In the second aim investigatesthe neural mechanisms by which NaV1.1 reduction induces cognitive impairments. Here injections will befocused on a specific structure the septo-hippocampal region which is the neural substrate of spatial memoryin rats. The role of interneurons in the physiological properties of this network is well characterized making thisan ideal network to investigate.The possibility that cognitive impairments may be caused by abnormal neuronal processing in addition toseizures would constitute a paradigm shift in the approach to DS and other childhood epilepsy disorders withpoor cognitive outcome. It would suggest that additional treatment strategies focusing on cognitive functionother than traditional antiepileptic drugs may be necessary to recover normal cognitive function in affectedchildren.,333594

DS is a catastrophic early-life encephalopathy associated with prolonged and recurrent early-life febrile seizures (FSs) treatment-resistant afebrile epilepsy ataxia and intellectual disability. GEFS+ is an inherited disorder characterized by FSs that persist beyond the age of six and the development of a wide range of adult epilepsy subtypes. To date research has focused mainly on the seizure component of these disorders; however we now recognize that seizure onset is often followed by cognitive stagnation/decline hyperactivity and the development of a number of behavioral comorbidities including autistic and psychotic traits. Although seizure frequency does tend to decline during adulthood these comorbidities persist and are a major challenge in the clinical management of this patient population. Currently the cognitive and behavioral outcomes associated with SCN1A dysfunction are poorly characterized and the factors that influence the severity of these deficits unknown. Mitigating the impact of these comorbidities on quality-of-lifeoutcomes will require broader research efforts to better characterize these cognitive and behavioral deficits as well as identify factors that influence their severity. Towards this end te proposed experiments in this R21 application will use Scn1a mouse models developed in our laboratory to address several fundamental gaps in our knowledge. Specifically we will 1) better define the cognitive and behavioral deficits that result from altered SCN1A function 2) determine whether prolonged early-life FSs which are a common clinical feature of SCN1A-derived epilepsies are likely to contribute to the worsening of cognitive and behavioral outcomes and 3) determine whether the emergence of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities requires altered SCN1A function during the early period of postnatal brain development or is an invariant (age-independent) outcome of altered SCN1A function. These experiments are both innovative and clinically relevant and will stimulate much-needed translational research.,193950

More recently we use a high-throughput targeted sequencing strategy to screen 73 known and candidate CEE genes for mutations in a cohort of >500 CEE probands identifying pathogenic mutations in >10% of patients. Our studies identified CHD2 and SYNGAP1 as novel and important causes of CEE GRIN2A as a cause of epilepsy-aphasia syndromes and GABRA1 and STXBP1 as causes of a subset of SCN1A- negative Dravet syndrome. In this proposal we build upon these successes and propose three lines of investigation. First we will extend our high-throughput screening discover additional genes for CEE and to establish the role of CEE genes in other related neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability with and without epilepsy. Second we will investigate the role of the chromatin remodeling pathway in epileptogenesis highlighted by the discovery of CHD2 mutations in a subset of CEE patients. Finally we will use a series of experiments to identify the ""missing"" mutations in Dravet syndrome a specific type of CEE. Successful completion of our aims will lead to improved genetic diagnosis of patients better prognosis and recurrence risk counseling for families and novel targets for development of therapeutics.",502532

Here we propose to assess the functional consequences of disease causing mutations on neuronal activity using two complementary genetic model systems: knock-in Drosophila with SCN1A mutations and iPSC-derived neurons from patients with the same mutations. Our preliminary data demonstrate that knock-in of a GEFS+ SCN1A mutation (K1270T) into the Drosophila sodium channel gene para causes a semi-dominant temperature-induced seizure phenotype. Electrophysiological studies of GABAergic interneurons in the brains of adult GEFS+ flies reveal a novel cellular mechanism underlying heat-induced seizure. Consistent with disease symptoms in humans the seizure phenotype caused by knock-in of a DS mutation (S1231R) is more severe than GEFS+. The congruence of the genotype-to-phenotype map between flies and human in this genetic disease model paves the way for use of knock-in Drosophila to study the mechanisms underlying these complex human genetic disorders.

Over 800 mutations in SCN1A encoding the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 have been reported patients. SCN1A mutations are associated with epilepsy phenotypes on the genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) spectrum. The GEFS+ spectrum ranges from simple febrile seizures on the mild end of the spectrum to Dravet syndrome on the severe end. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A result in Dravet syndrome an infant-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by a variety of seizure types developmental delay and elevated mortality risk. A common feature of monogenic epilepsies is variable expressivity in individuals carrying the same mutation suggesting that clinical severity is influenced by genetic modifiers. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a+/-) model a number of features of Dravet syndrome including spontaneous seizures and increased mortality risk. Loss of Scn1a results in reduced sodium current in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons which is predicted to increase excitability due to failure of inhibition. Phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice is stronglydependent on strain background. Scn1a+/- mice on the resistant 129 strain background (129.Scn1a+/-) have no overt phenotype and live a normal lifespan. In contrast Scn1a+/- mice on a (129xB6)F1 strain background (F1.Scn1a+/-) exhibit spontaneous seizures and premature lethality with 50% dying by 1 month of age. Based on the strain- dependent difference in phenotype we hypothesize that genetic modifiers influence Scn1a+/- phenotype severity. We recently mapped several modifier loci that influence premature lethality of Scn1a+/- mice. In the current proposal we will perform fine mapping and candidate gene analysis with the goal of identifying the responsible modifier genes. In addition to the strain-dependent differences in clinical severity we also observed strain-dependent differences in hippocampal neuron sodium currents (INa). GABAergic interneurons isolated from the F1.Scn1a+/- mice exhibit decreased INa density compared to wildtype littermate controls. In contrast INa density is preserved in GABAergic interneurons isolated from 129.Scn1a+/- and is no different from wildtype littermates. This suggests that interneurons from strain 129 compensate for the loss of Nav1.1 while F1 interneurons do not. Based on this observation we hypothesize that there are strain differences in compensatory capacity in the context of Scn1a heterozygous deletion. We propose to perform RNA-seq analysis to characterize hippocampal transcriptome differences during the critical phase of phenotype onset in susceptible F1.Scn1a+/- and resistant 129.Scn1a+/- mice. The results of this analysis will suggest candidate modifier genes and pathways that influence phenotype severity in Scn1a+/- mice. Identification of Dravet syndrome modifier genes will provide insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and will suggest novel therapeutic strategies for the improved treatment of human patients.      ",337969

We have developed a mouse genetic model with all the features of DS. This project will provide new insights into the mechanisms of pathophysiology of DS and will develop new therapeutic approaches to this disastrous childhood disease.                __SpecificAimsTextDelimiter__ Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a devastating childhood neuropsychiatric disorder caused by de novo heterozygousloss-of-function mutations in the brain type-I voltage-gated Na channel Nav1.11. Affected children developnormally for 6-9 months when repeated febrile seizures are followed by progression to severe spontaneousseizures and status epilepticus (SE). Co-morbidities of developmental delay and cognitive impairment appearwith age and teenage patients have IQ's of 50. Up to 15% of affected children die prematurely most oftenfrom Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). We have developed a mouse genetic model with all thefeatures of DS2. Mice become susceptible to thermal induction of seizures on postnatal day (P) 203 havespontaneous seizures on P2123 and develop ataxia4 circadian abnormalities5 sleep disorder6 cognitivedeficit7 autistic-like features7 and SUDEP28. All of these effects of DS are correlated with loss of Na currentsand excitability of specific classes of GABAergic interneurons without effects on excitatory neurons whichcauses imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neural circuits. Mutation of Nav1.1 channels specifically inforebrain GABAergic interneurons by the Cre-Lox method is sufficient to cause epilepsy premature deathcognitive impairment and autistic-like behaviors79 confirming that DS is caused by selective loss of Nav1.1channels in inhibitory neurons2. Remarkably cognitive deficit and autistic-like behaviors of DS mice can berescued by a single treatment with a low dose of the benzodiazepine GABA-A receptor co-activatorclonazepam (CLN) demonstrating that these life-changing co-morbidities are caused by the mutation ofNav1.1 channel itself rather than by neuronal damage from recurrent seizures7. Our Central Hypothesis is (i)epilepsy and co-morbidities in DS result from failure of excitability of GABAergic inhibitory neurons whichcreates an imbalance of excitation vs. inhibition in neural circuits and (ii) re-balancing excitation and inhibitionwith drug treatment will have therapeutic value for epilepsy SUDEP and co-morbidities in DS. To furtheradvance understanding of the cell biology pathophysiology and treatment of DS our Specific Aims are:1. Hyperexcitability of cells and circuits in DS mice. It is not known which classes of interneurons areinvolved in DS. Our results from brain slice recordings show decreased excitability of interneurons in thehippocampus and cerebral cortex. Fast-spiking inhibitory neurons have impaired excitability and Martinotti cellshave impaired disynaptic inhibition of pyramidal cells. We will use specific deletion of Nav1.1 channels indifferent classes of interneurons by the Cre-Lox method to determine which subtypes of interneuronscontribute to the failure of control of electrical excitability in DS mice. We will use localized microinjection andexpression of Cre from viral vectors to define the anatomical locations in which failure of expression of Nav1.1channels can lead to hyperexcitability and epilepsy. We will determine the physiological effects of these genedeletions using brain slice recording methods. We will use optogenetic methods to rescue excitability of therelevant GABAergic interneurons and thereby provide proof-of-concept for their role in DS. Our results will giveunique insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that lead to epilepsy and premature death in DS mice.2. Epileptogenesis in DS mice. Na currents are reduced at P14 in interneurons in DS mice but spontaneousseizures are first evident at P21 and reach peak at P25. In brain slices action potential generation ininterneurons is impaired at P21. We will use brain slice recording methods to document the changes inexcitability of cells and circuits in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex during this 12-day period ofepileptogenesis. In addition we will use immunocytochemical and mouse genetic approaches to identify thesites of hyperexcitability that appear first in DS mice in vivo and thereby determine the time course of changesin excitability of cells and circuits that lead to epilepsy. Imaging of Ca bound to CaM and parvalbumin (PV) willgive a visual record of increased excitability. In vivo labeling by induced activity-dependent expression offluorescently tagged Immediate Early Genes (IEG) in TRAP mice10 will give a high-resolution view ofdevelopment of hyperexcitability in defined time windows. Optogenetic-driven expression of Cre in relevantinterneurons will be used to interrupt the epileptogenesis process and provide proof-of-concept for the role ofspecific cell types in development of epilepsy.3. Status epilepticus in DS mice. Patients with DS have repetitive prolonged episodes of SE. We will induceSE by prolonged thermal induction of seizures in DS mice and determine the changes in excitability of cellsand circuits following one or more episodes of SE. We will assess cell injury by measurements of reactiveastrocytes neuroinflammation apoptosis and neuronal cell death.4. Novel therapeutics in DS mice. Our results indicate that novel rationally designed drug combinations areeffective in reducing seizures and premature death in DS mice with minimal side effects and that a single low-dose CLN treatment can rescue cognitive deficit and autistic-like behaviors. We will optimize combinationtherapy with CLN and other GABA-A receptor activators plus tiagabine in order to develop a therapeuticregime that prevents seizures premature death and cognitive impairment and minimizes tolerance duringchronic treatment. We will examine the effectiveness of new-generation subunit-selective GABA-A receptorco-activators.

DS is a catastrophic early-life encephalopathy associated with prolonged and recurrent early-life febrile seizures (FSs) treatment-resistant afebrile epilepsy ataxia and intellectual disability. GEFS+ is an inherited disorder characterized by FSs that persist beyond the age of six and the development of a wide range of adult epilepsy subtypes. To date research has focused mainly on the seizure component of these disorders; however we now recognize that seizure onset is often followed by cognitive stagnation/decline hyperactivity and the development of a number of behavioral comorbidities including autistic and psychotic traits. Although seizure frequency does tend to decline during adulthood these comorbidities persist and are a major challenge in the clinical management of this patient population. Currently the cognitive and behavioral outcomes associated with SCN1A dysfunction are poorly characterized and the factors that influence the severity of these deficits unknown. Mitigating the impact of these comorbidities on quality-of-lifeoutcomes will require broader research efforts to better characterize these cognitive and behavioral deficits as well as identify factors that influence their severity. Towards this end te proposed experiments in this R21 application will use Scn1a mouse models developed in our laboratory to address several fundamental gaps in our knowledge. Specifically we will 1) better define the cognitive and behavioral deficits that result from altered SCN1A function 2) determine whether prolonged early-life FSs which are a common clinical feature of SCN1A-derived epilepsies are likely to contribute to the worsening of cognitive and behavioral outcomes and 3) determine whether the emergence of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities requires altered SCN1A function during the early period of postnatal brain development or is an invariant (age-independent) outcome of altered SCN1A function. These experiments are both innovative and clinically relevant and will stimulate much-needed translational research.      ",232950

In this study we will examine the contribution of the voltage-gated sodium channel genes SCN1A and SCN8A to seizure generation and seizure protection respectively. This study will provide important clinically relevant information on the mechanisms of epilepsy and the range of different epilepsy subtypes that can be potentially treated by selectively targeting SCN8A. )      ,NINDS,8690177,6/25/2014 0:00,PA-10-067,5R01NS072221-04,5,R01,NS,72221,4, ,"LEENDERS, MIRIAM",7/1/2011 0:00,6/30/2016 0:00,Genetics of Health and Disease Study Section[GHD], ,7347049,"ESCAYG, ANDREW P",Not Applicable,5,GENETICS,66469933,S352L5PJLMP8,66469933,S352L5PJLMP8,US,33.791247,-84.3249,2384501,EMORY UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,GA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,303221007,UNITED STATES,N,7/1/2014 0:00,6/30/2016 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2014,322458, ,NINDS,241762,80696, ,  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   PROJECT SUMMARY Mutations in the SCN1A voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) are responsible for a growing number of disorders including genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) Dravet syndrome (DS or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy) and familial hemiplegic migraine. To better understand the mechanism by which SCN1A dysfunction leads to epilepsy we generated transgenic and knock-in mice with the human SCN1A mutation R1648H. These mutants exhibit spontaneous seizures reduced seizure thresholds and shortened life spans. Electrophysiological analysis of cortical neurons revealed reduced function in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons but the biophysical mechanisms were different - negatively shifted voltage dependence of fast inactivation in excitatory neurons versus slowed recovery from inactivation in inhibitory neurons. Our results and data from other groups led to the hypothesis that reduced GABAergic inhibition plays the major role in the pathogenesis of GEFS+ and DS. However a direct causal link between SCN1A function in interneurons or pyramidal cells and seizure generation has not yet been established. In Aim 1 we will selectively delete Scn1a from either interneurons or pyramidal cells to directly establish the relative contribution of each cell type to seizure generation. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that early-life febrile seizures (FSs) which are a prominent clinical feature of both GEFS+ and DS have an impact on disease progression. We will also explore the mechanistic basis for the relationship between FSs and disease outcome and possible pharmacological interventions. Of further relevance to our ultimate goal of finding better treatments for epilepsy is our observation that altered function of the Scn8a VGSC can restore normal seizure thresholds and life spans to an Scn1a knockout model of DS. This observation led us to hypothesize that selective targeting of SCN8A may make an effective treatment for DS which is often refractory to available medications. In Aim 3 we will investigate whether altering Scn8a function can also ameliorate other genetic forms of epilepsy and types of seizures. This study will provide important information on the role of VGSCs in the maintenance of normal neuronal excitability and in the development of epilepsy. These experiments are innovative clinically relevant and will stimulate much-needed translational research.    ,322458

The patients suffering from DS have intractable seizures and mental impairment and with poor outcome. In this proposal we will use a mouse model which harbors a mutation causing DS in humans and manifests the symptoms seen in humans with DS to study the detailed underlying mechanisms of DS and to develop a novel therapeutic strategy against this disorder.            ",NINDS,8665500,5/21/2014 0:00,PA-11-260,5R01NS082635-02,5,R01,NS,82635,2, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",7/1/2013 0:00,6/30/2018 0:00,Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section[CNNT], ,8897491,"KANG, JING-QIONG ",Not Applicable,5,NEUROLOGY,965717143,GTNBNWXJ12D5,965717143,DWH7MSXKA2A8; GTNBNWXJ12D5,US,36.143381,-86.803365,8721001,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,Nashville,TN,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,372032408,UNITED STATES,N,7/1/2014 0:00,6/30/2015 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2014,337837, ,NINDS,216562,121275, ,"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): GABAA receptor subunit gene mutations are frequently associated with epilepsy. Most such epilepsy syndromes are rather benign and are outgrown as patient age. However truncation mutations in the GABAA receptor gamma2 subunit gene GABRgamma2 are often but not always associated with a more severe phenotype Dravet syndrome (DS). To date most DS patients are associated with SCN1A loss of function mutations that result in impaired GABAergic interneuron activity and action potential firing. Synaptic GABAA receptors mediate inhibitory GABAergic transmission and characterizations of DS mouse model harboring GABRgamma2 (Q351X) mutation would provide new insights into the pathogenesis of DS as well as epilepsy in general. Combination of understandings from both SCN1A and GABRgamma2 mouse models will help pinpoint the final common pathophysiologic pathway on which two distinct groups of mutations converge. GABRgamma2 (Q351X) mutation is associated with two DS pedigrees. The heterozygous GABRgamma2 (Q351X) knockin (KI) mice which are patient condition recapitulate the major features of DS. The mice displayed multiple neurodevelopmental abnormalities and multiple forms of epilepsy including generalized tonic clonic epilepsy suggesting impaired synapse formation and function. Since simple GABRgamma2 gene knockout (KO) heterozygous mice do not have seizures this suggests that presence of the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunit protein and its related pathology contribute to the severe DS phenotype. We have previously demonstrated that the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunits were loss of function. Additionally the mutant protein accumulated intracellularly formed aggregates and imposed a dominant-negative effect on the wildtype subunits. The mutant aggregates were identified by mass spectrometry and the components of the aggregates were similar to those identified in inclusions found in neurodegenerative diseases such as the Lewy bodies characteristic of Parkinson's disease. Our pilot data demonstrated that the mutant protein also formed substantial aggregates in the heterozygous KI mice. The mutant subunits impaired GABAergic synaptogenesis and GABAergic transmission. The single quantum dot imaging indicated the synapse vs. extrasynapse distribution of GABAA receptors were altered in the mutant KI mice. We hypothesize that the accumulation and aggregation of the mutant gamma2 (Q351X) subunits impair synapse development and GABAergic transmission thus resulting in the severe phenotype as DS. In this proposal we will characterize in detail the mutant subunit accumulation aggregation and its impact on synapse formation stabilization connectivity and transmission. We will also characterize adaptive changes of wildtype GABAA receptor expression distribution mobility and turnover as well as neurobehaviors in the mutant GABRG2 (Q351X) heterozygous KI mice. We found overexpression of heat shock protein (Hsp)70 and Hsp40 reduced the total mutant and aggregated gamma2 subunit protein. We thus propose to test a novel therapeutic strategy by upregulating chaperones like Hsp70 and Hsp40 in the mutant KI mice.      ",337837

Mutations in SCN1B in humans are linked to Genetic Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus (GEFS+)-spectrum disorders. Complete functional loss of SCN1B results in Dravet Syndrome a severe pediatric epileptic encephalopathy on the GEFS+ spectrum. Scn1b null mice are models of Dravet Syndrome. We will test whether SCN1B is crucial for establishment of excitability in brain. We propose that b1B which is expressed during brain development is essential to SCN1B function.

SCN1B is expressed as two splice variants in brain: 21 and 21B (initially called 21A). 21B is predominantly expressed in developing brain while 21 expression prevails after the first postnatal week. 21 and 21B share the N-terminal immunoglobulin domain in SCN1B that is required for cell adhesion. Mutations in SCN1B in humans are linked to Genetic Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus (GEFS+)-spectrum disorders. A mutation causing complete functional loss of SCN1B results in Dravet Syndrome a pediatric epileptic encephalopathy that is the most severe disorders of the GEFS+ spectrum. Scn1b null mice have severe spontaneous epilepsy and early lethality a phenotype similar to Dravet Syndrome. In addition loss of Scn1b in mice results in neuronal migration and pathfinding abnormalities disrupted axonal fasciculation INa abnormalities altered VGSC expression in the hippocampus and mistargeting of Nav1.6 to the axon initial segment (AIS) in cerebellum. Thus disruptions in SCN1B expression during development may lead to a spectrum of neurological diseases. The long-term goal of this work is to understand the physiological role of SCN1B in brain. The objective here is to determine the roles of 21 and 21B in neuronal excitability. The central hypothesis to be tested is that SCN1B is crucial for establishment of excitability in brain. It is proposed that 21B which is expressed during late prenatal/early postnatal brain development is essential to SCN1B function. Further it is proposed that disruptions in SCN1B expression during this critical developmental period result in defects in brain circuitry as well as aberrant VGSC subcellular localization in neurons that lead to secondary changes in excitability. The rationale for this work is that understanding the role of SCN1B in brain development may lead to novel treatments targeting SCN1B for epilepsy. Three specific aims will be pursued: 1: To test whether Scn1b expression during brain development is critical for establishment of excitability in vivo. 2: To determine whether Scn1b-mediated epilepsy is an interneuronopathy. 3: To use human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons to understand the role of Scn1b in human epilepsy. This work is expected to reveal the physiological roles of Scn1b (21 and 21B) in brain development and how defects in Scn1b expression contribute to epilepsy in mice and humans. These results will have positive impact because these identified roles will lead to greater understanding of the mechanisms of GEFS+-spectrum diseases and may lead to novel therapeutic agents for epilepsy.,404104

A variety of inherited disorders affecting skeletal muscle contraction (hyperkalemic periodic paralysis paramyotonia congenita K+-aggravated myotonia) cardiac excitability (congenital long QT syndrome idiopathic ventricular fibrillation familial conduction system disease) and certain forms of epilepsy have been associated with mutations in human NaV channel genes. This proposal is a competing renewal of R01-NS32387 that for 17 years has funded our efforts to elucidate the molecular genetic pathophysiologic and pharmacologic mechanisms of human sodium ""channelopathies"". We propose to continue our highly successful research program with a focus on epilepsies associated with mutant brain NaV channels. In Specific Aim 1 we will elucidate the functional consequences of novel epilepsy-associated SCN1A (encoding NaV1.1) mutations with a focus on two unstudied mechanistic aspects of mutant channel dysfunction. First we will investigate the functional consequences of a subset of mutations within a region of the NaV1.1 C-terminus having conserved Ca2+/calmodulin regulatory elements to test the hypothesis that these alleles affect channel function by altering the response of the channel to internal Ca2+ signaling. Second we will investigate whether alternative splicing influences the functional consequences of SCN1A mutations associated with divergent clinical phenotypes. In Specific Aim 2 we will elucidate the neurophysiological basis for strain- dependent epilepsy severity using two mechanistically distinct mouse models of epilepsy caused by mutant NaV channels: 1) transgenic mice expressing a gain-of-function Scn2a mutation (Q54 mice); and 2) heterozygous Scn1a knock out (Scn1a+/-) mice a model of human Dravet syndrome. Both models exhibit strong strain-dependence of epilepsy severity and impaired survival. Strain-dependence of murine phenotypes mimics the variable penetrance and disease expression characteristic of human monogenic epilepsies including those caused by mutant NaV channels. Ongoing efforts to map genomic loci responsible for this phenomenon have identified a new candidate gene for seizure susceptibility using Q54 mice. By integrating existing and future genomic data on modifiers of epilepsy with information about the neurophysiological correlates of phenotype strain-dependence we expect to generate important new insights into mechanisms responsible for the influence of genetic modifiers relevant to human idiopathic epilepsy and to identify molecular pathways that could be therapeutic targets.

As a simple vertebrate species amenable to rapid genetic manipulation and high-throughput drug screening we propose an alternative approach using mutant zebrafish (Danio rerio) with spontaneous recurrent seizure phenotypes (i.e. epilepsy) as a platform to identify new treatments for medically refractory epilepsy. We recently began to explore the possibility that spontaneous single-gene mutations in zebrafish - especially those mimicking catastrophic forms of epilepsy often seen in children - result in epileptic phenotypes. Zebrafish mutants featuring a loss-of-function sodium channel (Nav1.1/SCN1A) mutation (e.g. a gene family identified in children with Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy and Dravet syndrome) were recently identified by our laboratory as epileptic zebrafish with phenotypes similar to the human condition. Using large-scale transcriptome analysis automated behavioral tracking in vivo electrophysiology and pharmacological approaches we describe a novel approach to further our understanding and potential treatment of debilitating epilepsy disorders associated with Nav1.1 mutation. In this EUREKA proposal we will use these mutant zebrafish in our efforts to (i) identify molecular targets for therapeutic treatment of DS/SMEI and (ii) identify drug candidates for therapeutic treatment of DS/SMEI. Our results promise to establish an alternative zebrafish-based approach for high-throughput small-molecule drug discovery targeted to monogenic epilepsy disorders seen primarily in children.,305910

SCN1A mutations have also been describedin autism and reduced levels of Nav1.1 are observed in various models of Alzheimer disease (AD). Nav1.1 ishighly expressed in inhibitory interneurons that as we defend here not only explains seizures but alsocognitive impairments. Interneurons play a critical role in information processing by controlling the timing ofaction potentials and oscillatory activities. Alterations of such fundamental components of the neuronal circuitryare likely to have profound consequences on neural processing and therefore cognition.The goal of this proposal is to investigate the physiological mechanisms leading to cognitive impairments anddetermine if there is a critical period of development where cognitive systems are permanently sensitive to themutation effects. To approach this question we have developed a technique to transiently suppress Nav1.1expression using RNA interference in rats. This procedure induced cognitive impairments without seizures inrats and can be targeted at specific structures and initiated at specific developmental periods. We hypothesizethat NaV1.1 deficits will be sufficient to affect neuronal coding oscillatory activity and cognition. Wealso hypothesize that there is a critical period during which cognitive development is particularlysensitive to NaV1.1 abnormalities.To test these hypotheses we will combine in vivo RNA interference dynamic analysis of electro-encephalographic (EEG) oscillations and single cell electrophysiology (place cells) in rats performing memorytasks. The first part of this project will be to determine if there is a critical period during which NaV1.1 is criticalfor cognitive development. We will investigate the acute and long-term cognitive outcomes of intraventricularsiRNA administration performed at different periods of post-natal development. In the second aim investigatesthe neural mechanisms by which NaV1.1 reduction induces cognitive impairments. Here injections will befocused on a specific structure the septo-hippocampal region which is the neural substrate of spatial memoryin rats. The role of interneurons in the physiological properties of this network is well characterized making thisan ideal network to investigate.The possibility that cognitive impairments may be caused by abnormal neuronal processing in addition toseizures would constitute a paradigm shift in the approach to DS and other childhood epilepsy disorders withpoor cognitive outcome. It would suggest that additional treatment strategies focusing on cognitive functionother than traditional antiepileptic drugs may be necessary to recover normal cognitive function in affectedchildren.,330259

Identification of epilepsy modifier genes and analysis of the underlying mechanisms will provide insight into the molecular events of epileptogenesis. This will contribute to understanding the basis of epilepsy with more complex inheritance and suggest novel therapeutic targets for the improved treatment of human patients        ,NINDS,8609606,1/17/2014 0:00,PA-10-067,5R01NS053792-10,5,R01,NS,53792,10, ,"WHITTEMORE, VICKY R",5/25/2006 0:00,6/30/2014 0:00,Genetics of Health and Disease Study Section[GHD], ,1910828,"KEARNEY, JENNIFER A",Not Applicable,5,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,965717143,GTNBNWXJ12D5,965717143,DWH7MSXKA2A8; GTNBNWXJ12D5,US,36.143381,-86.803365,8721001,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,Nashville,TN,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,372032408,UNITED STATES,N,3/1/2014 0:00,6/30/2014 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2014,159960, ,NINDS,104777,55183, ,  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels have been associated with several types of human epilepsy including Genetic (Generalized) Epilepsy with Febrile Seizure Plus (GEFS+) and Dravet Syndrome. Within these genetic epilepsies there is variable penetrance and expressivity of the clinical phenotype suggesting a role for genetic modifiers. We have developed mouse models with mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels and seizure-related phenotypes with different underlying mechanisms. Scn2aQ54 transgenic mice have a gain-of-function mutation that results in spontaneous adult-onset partial motor seizures and models features of GEFS+. Heterozygous Scn1a+/- null mice are a model of Dravet Syndrome a severe infant-onset epilepsy with progressive worsening accompanied by psychomotor regression. A common feature of these mouse models is that epilepsy severity varies depending on the genetic strain background suggesting that genetic modifiers influence the phenotype. Scn2aQ54 mice on the resistant C57BL/6J background have delayed onset decreased severity and improved survival compared to the susceptible (C57BL/6J x SJL/J)F1 background. Conversely the epilepsy phenotype of Scn1a+/- mice is more severe on the C57BL/6J background while they have delayed onset and improved survival on the 129S6/SvEvTac strain background. Based on these observations we hypothesize that multiple genetic modifiers act to influence penetrance and expressivity of the primary epilepsy mutation. Previously we mapped two modifier loci that are responsible for the strain difference in Scn2aQ54 mice: Moe1 (modifier of epilepsy 1) on Chromosome 11 and Moe2 on Chromosome 19. During the previous funding period we performed fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of the Moe1 region identified the Moe2 modifier gene and identified additional modifier loci that influence the Scn2aQ54 phenotype. We propose to continue our analysis of epilepsy modifiers using the Scn2aQ54 and Scn1a+/- mouse models. First we will identify the responsible genes at Scn2aQ54 modifier loci. Next we will determine the molecular basis of the Moe2 modifier effect. Finally we will map genetic modifier loci in the Scn1a+/- mouse model and perform transcriptome analysis via RNA-seq for accelerated identification of candidate genes. The major goal of our studies is to identify and characterize modifier genes that influence epilepsy susceptibility and severity. These genes are likely to contribute to common epilepsy syndromes with more complex genetics. Identification of epilepsy modifier genes will provide insight into the basic biology of epileptogenesis and may identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of human patients.    ,159960
